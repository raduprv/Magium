[2]"This is where I wanted to bring you. Please, tell me what you can tell by studying the magic in this place..."

As I concentrate on the nature of the magic around me, I start sensing strong traces of elemental magic.

"It seems there's been at least one elementalist battling here," I tell her.

"Yes, but can you tell which element the caster was using?"

I try to focus even further. 

"It's uh... I'm not sure how to describe it. It doesn't seem to be any of the four traditional elements. If I were to put it into words, I'd say it would be... electric, in nature."

Kate's face slowly lights up when she hears my words. This is the first time I've seen her smile, even if only slightly, ever since we've first met.

"Thank you, stillw-- Barry... You've really been a great help!"

Her reaction took me by surprise.

"Wow. This is the first time I see this side of you. I didn't know you could actually be... nice."

"What's that supposed to mean?"


[3]"Wait," she says. "There's something that's been bothering me since this morning."

She looks really tense. It seems that she's struggling to get the words out of her mouth.

"Were you..."

She pauses.

"Were you really smitten with me since you first saw me?"

Of all the things I would have expected her to say to me right now, this was the last of them. Thanks a lot, Daren. What am I supposed to tell her, now?


[4]Kate shifts her gaze back to me.

"But you and Rose... you're different. When I talk to you, I see neither fear nor apprehension in your eyes. You speak to me as normally as you would speak with any other person. I do not know why that is. I do not know what's wrong with you, but... thank you... for making me feel part of a group for the first time in my life."

"Hey, there you are!" Daren shouts from a distance, as he and Rose come back from the forest. "We found Rose's bag not far from here. It's still got all her herbs inside. We should be good to go."

When he gets closer, he looks at me and Kate and says:

"I'm sorry, did we interrupt something?"

[6]"You realize you could have asked me to enchant it for you, right? It literally only takes a few minutes. Here, give me that."

Daren grabs my backpack and enters an enchanting trance. His eyes become yellow and the backpack starts to glow. The fact that Daren specializes on item enchanting had completely slipped my mind. Enchanted backpacks are leagues better than normal ones. They have almost infinite space, and people can't see what's inside them, so they can only steal your stuff if they know exactly what they're looking for. Taking an item out of an enchanted backpack is as simple as focusing on its image, and reaching inside for it.

Rose is looking very interested in the enchanting process. She is now studying Daren closely.

"Hey, Barry," Daren says. "Do you want to have your backpack extra secure or should I just leave it like this? If I secure it, then only you will be able to take items out of it. The only downside is that you can't really authorize other persons to take items from your backpack once you secure it. Normally, security shouldn't be much of a problem with these backpacks because someone has to actually know what you have inside before taking an item, but it never hurts to be safe."

[8]"Thank you... and I'm sorry," Rose says, as she bows, and then turns away from the deer.

"Here are your things," Elaria says, as she shows us our backpacks. "I took the liberty of making some more food for you, in case you get hungry and want to eat something other than roots and berries."

"Thank you for all your help," I tell her. "I hope we meet again!"

"It's a small continent. I'm sure our paths will cross again someday."

Kate and I say our goodbyes to the two deer, and we go on our way.

Before leaving, I make sure to take with me my spoils of war from this morning's skirmishes: a crossbow from one of the crossbowmen who ambushed us and a dagger from one of Cutthroat Dave's men.

We join back with Rose, and we set off on our long road ahead. 

Rose is looking a little distraught after her discussion with Elaria. I wonder if I should say something to her, given the circumstances?

[11]"Full? Wait a minute, Barry, you're telling me that the backpack you are carrying with you right now is actually a completely regular one?"

"Well, yeah, enchanted backpacks are really hard to come by if you're not a mage."

[15]We spent the next few hours travelling south, taking the most direct route available to Rose's town. Her usual route was designed to avoid most areas that are known to be frequented by monsters, but Daren insisted on delivering the cure to the sick as soon as possible, and said that our group should be more than able to handle a few monster attacks.

The scenery that we've seen during our travel has been rather underwhelming. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I always thought that the fabled continent of Varathia would be filled with all sorts of natural wonders and mythical creatures. All I've seen today were your everyday pine and oak forests, with a lake or a river here and there to keep it from becoming completely monotonous. At least it's been a few hours since the last time we've been attacked, which is quite an achievement, judging by how this tournament has been going so far. 

Kate seems to have somewhat recovered since this morning, but she still looks weak, and she almost lost her balance a few times while we were walking. When Rose asked her if she'd rather we take a break, she said that she'll be fine and that we should keep going without worrying about her.


[16]I realize I'm sweating. Kate is watching me intently.

"But, uh... what about escorting Rose home?"

"What about it?" Daren asks. "Me and Kate should be more than enough to deal with a few monsters."

"Yes but, I..."

Words fail me. I can't think up an excuse fast enough.

"I don't..."

As I struggle to find my words, Daren finally starts to understand what's going on. His expression is getting darker, and more serious.

"Barry, you didn't really come here against your will, did you?"

"No... No I didn't."

"Then what are you doing here?"

"I... joined for the same reason as everyone else. I'm after the Magium. It's been my dream to become a mage for as long as I can remember."

"When were you planning on telling me this?"


[17]I realize I'm sweating. Kate is watching me intently.

"Oh, now that you mention it, I think the fruits were blue with white spots, not purple."

"I'm pretty sure that plants with blue spotted fruits cannot have long leaves. What kind of medicine do you need these plants for? Maybe I can help you make it."

"It's, uh.. a medicine for, uh..."

Words fail me. I can't think up a name fast enough.

"I don't..."

As I struggle to find my words, Daren finally starts to understand what's going on. His expression is getting darker, and more serious.

"Barry, you didn't really come here looking for medicinal herbs, did you?"

"No... No I didn't."

"Then what are you doing here?"

"I... joined for the same reason as everyone else. I'm after the Magium. It's been my dream to become a mage for as long as I can remember."

"And that story about your sister, that was all a lie too?"

"Yes..."

[24]"She died long ago, when she gave birth to my little sister."

"Oh... I'm sorry."

Rose smiles.

"There's no need, you couldn't have known."

"So, how did you all handle the death of your grand priest?" Daren asks, trying to change the subject. "You said that he was the last person alive that could create food out of nothing in your city, so I imagine there must have been some backup plan in case of his inevitable death?"

"Oh, yes, many people have started to learn agriculture, but the problem is that most of the fertile terrain around our town is already owned by the nobles. By planting your seeds further away from the town, you run a great risk of getting your crops raided by monsters."


[25]I never thought about it this way. It's true that there are some mages that actually use their magic to augment their powers, in a similar way that this device does. Does that make me one of them?

"I suppose..." I answer her. "But it's only temporary. The device will run out of energy once I'm no longer surrounded by all these powerful mages to extract it from."

I take a look at my stat booster and start to think of what I should spend my newly acquired points on.


[26]Shortly after the second roar ended, a very powerful wind started to blow towards us. I can almost feel it trying to lift me in the air. The trees are barely holding up, and it looks as if they could get pulled out of their roots at any moment. We're lucky that this happened while we were in a clearing, because otherwise we would have had to also protect ourselves from falling trees, while trying to hold our ground against the relentless force of the wind.

As some of the trees start to fall, a monstrous figure makes its appearance high above us. It's at least fifty foot tall, with very tough looking red scales covering its entire body, and wings the size of sails on a longship. Its claws look as sharp as blades, and its fangs are bared at us menacingly, but its overall appearance is not much different from that of an overgrown lizard. 

A dragon. They really existed. Is this all happening because of my disappointment for not encountering any mythical creatures so far? If that's the case, then I take it back. I take it all back, just, please, let this all be a dream. Let this all just be the end of a bad dream, before I wake up back in our cave, and then we can start our journey anew. 

"Get down!!!" Daren shouts to us, as the dragon gets closer, and then lands a few dozen feet in front of us, making the whole ground tremble violently under its weight. 

"No..." Rose says, unable to control her shivering, and barely able to keep her balance anymore. "This can't be happening. This can't be happening..."


[27]"Quick, everyone get behind me!" Daren shouts, as he raises his shield, and a semi-transparent magical barrier starts to form around us.

Kate doubles up our protection by also making a dome of thick ice to surround us. The dragon, who has now raised himself to a sufficiently high altitude unleashes a downpour of flames upon us. As the flames collide with our protections, we start to feel the air heating up all around us. Kate's ice has already melted away, and all that's standing between us and the torrent of fire is Daren's magical barrier.

Rose is now sitting on the ground, with a terrified look in her eyes, hugging her legs and shaking violently.

"Rose!" Kate yells at her. "Snap out of it! We'll need to be ready to get out of here as soon as Daren's barrier breaks. Do you hear me?!"

The dragon's flames have suddenly stopped. Looking up to see what happened, I am terrified to learn that the monster is now quickly diving towards us. Kate tries to make another wall of ice between us and the dragon, but it breaks through it in a second, and then clashes with Daren's magical barrier, shattering it in an instant. The dragon then grabs Daren in one of its claws, and soars back up into the sky. We can hear Daren's screams as the giant lizard tries to crush him. 


[28]"You are a fool for challenging me on my own territory, dragon hunter. I've killed hundreds of your kind in the last millennia. I've watched your pathetic human race fumble their way through life ever since they stopped walking on four legs. I could have killed or enslaved you all at any point in your miserable existence, if it weren't beneath me. But now you dare rise against me? Your charred remains will serve as my gift for Eiden, to welcome him back to my realm."

The dragon soars to the sky, as it shouts its final words to us.

"Pray to your gods, humans! They're the only ones that can save you from the onslaught that will follow."

"Pray to your gods, humans! They're the only ones that can save you from the onslaught that will follow."

"Quick, everyone get behind me!" Daren shouts, as he raises his shield, and a semi-transparent magical barrier starts to form around us.

Kate doubles up our protection by also making a dome of thick ice to surround us. The dragon, who has now raised himself to a sufficiently high altitude unleashes a downpour of flames upon us. As the flames collide with our protections, we start to feel the air heating up all around us. Kate's ice has already melted away, and all that's standing between us and the torrent of fire is Daren's magical barrier.

Rose is now sitting on the ground, with a terrified look in her eyes, hugging her legs and shaking violently.


[33]"It's over, humans," the dragon shouts triumphantly from high above. "Your era is at an end. I am going to exterminate every single one of you, until all that remains of your race is a forgotten memory. And I'm saving Eiden for last."

It's no use. My stat device is worthless here. Even if I had all of my stats maxed out I wouldn't stand a chance. This was all over before it began.

As the dragon's flames pour down on us, I close my eyes, awaiting for my impending doom. After a few seconds of keeping my eyes closed, I realize that I'm still alive. I open my eyes back up and find out to my surprise that the dragon's flames have stopped in mid-air, a few inches before reaching us, as if they were frozen. But that is not all. Looking around me, I see that everything else is frozen too. Daren, Kate and Rose are all standing completely still, and I can't even feel the wind anymore. 

"Seriously, now," I hear a familiar voice behind me. "How could I have let him win after saying a line like that?"

I quickly turn around and see Eiden standing behind me, with his eyes closed as usual and a smile on his face.

"I mean, I don't think I've even read a children's book where the main villain gloats to such an extent. It's embarrassing, really."


[34]Daren quickly rushes to her position and provides her with cover before her ice melts away. Unfortunately, the fight has weakened him as well, and he does not manage to hold the barrier for long. His barrier breaks, and his shield drops to the ground, right when the dragon finishes its attack. The explosion of air generated by the destruction of Daren's barrier sent Rose flying, and she hit her head on a rock. She is now lying on the ground, motionless.

Think, Barry. Think. What can you do to turn the tide? There has to be something. There has to be a way to use everything you know to your advantage. There has to be a way. Think!!!

"It's over, humans," the dragon shouts triumphantly from high above. "Your era is at an end. I am going to exterminate every single one of you, until all that remains of your race is a forgotten memory. And I'm saving Eiden for last."

[35]"W-What are you doing?" Rose asks him.

"Interesting," Eiden says. "Rose, I've cast a spell that is supposed to freeze time for everyone except me and Barry. Have you by any chance studied time magic in your lifetime?"

"Uh.. no, I can't cast any magic at all. I'm not a mage."

Eiden's smile widens.

"Then I offer you my sincerest congratulations. As of this moment, you are officially a time weaver!"

"A... what?"

Eiden turns to me.

"Barry, I must admit, I don't think I've ever seen such diversity in a team before. A time weaver, a healer in armor, a survivor from the Beacon of Hope and a stat device wielder. I think I'm starting to root for you!"


[36]"Um... Hi... My name is Rose. Are you a friend of Barry?"

Eiden furrows his brows, and makes a hand gesture towards Rose.

"W-What are you doing?" Rose asks him.

"Interesting," Eiden says. "Rose, I've cast a spell that is supposed to freeze time for everyone except me and Barry. Have you by any chance studied time magic in your lifetime?"

"Uh.. no, I can't cast any magic at all. I'm not a mage."

[38]"I believe your ultimate goal was to win this tournament and become a mage, was it not? Well, Barry, I am now giving you a taste of that power. For about five minutes, you will have magical powers comparable to mine. More than enough to drive off the dragon, I'd wager. All of the information you need in order to use your powers should have been transferred into your mind by the stat device. I'm looking forward to watching your battle!"

Eiden then starts to fade into thin air. When only his outline is visible anymore, he says:

"Oh, and I'd recommend starting with a magical barrier. Your friends don't seem to be doing very well."


[39]"Hey!!!"

"I realize this must all be very confusing for you, Barry, so I'm going to provide you with a little bit of context. The beast that just attacked you is Tyrath, the self proclaimed king of all dragons. The reason he's looking for me is because I wrote a message in the stars last night in an ancient language used primarily by dragon hunters. The message's purpose was to let all dragon hunters who entered this contest know that a dragon exists on this island, and to give them all a little extra incentive to hunt him down. I very much doubt that any of them will pose a realistic threat to him, but it will be fun to watch."

He finishes charging up my stat device and then hands it back to me. As I hold it in my hand, I can feel a powerful surge of magical energy run through me and flow through all of my body. 

"I believe your ultimate goal was to win this tournament and become a mage, was it not? Well, Barry, I am now giving you a taste of that power.

[41]I conjure another protective barrier around me and Rose just in time to defend us from the incoming flames. My barrier is holding up much better than Daren's. There's no sign of it breaking any time soon, and I'm barely even feeling the heat outside of it. 

The question is, what am I going to do now? Looking at my device, I can see that my stats have remained exactly the same and I have no extra available points, so then what did Eiden do to it? I'll need to figure this out later. 

At any rate, judging by the amount of extra energy I can sense in the stat device and the speed at which it's getting consumed, I'd say that the estimate Eiden gave me is spot on. I have less than five minutes to finish this fight, but even with all this magical power, the dragon may well pulverize me in a one on one fight if I don't do this right. Both Daren and Kate are too exhausted to assist me, so I'm on my own for the time being.  Even as I'm standing here thinking, time is running out, but can I afford to just start fighting without any plan whatsoever?


[42]The strong wind he can generate with his wings might also be a problem. It felt like I was trying to fight a hurricane when the dragon first made his appearance, so I guess I could also use some spells that give me protection from wind.

Other than that, it's anyone's guess. It is said that some of the older dragons can cast magic, but I do not know if Tyrath is one of them. More than that, I have no way of knowing which kind of magic he'd be specialized in.

I'm going to have to decide which protection spells I cast in the limited time I have at my disposal.


[43]Shapeshifting magic is pretty useless in this situation, because of two main reasons. First of all, these spells cannot be used to transform into something much bigger than my actual size, so it's not like I can just turn into a dragon and fight Tyrath on equal footing. Secondly, you cannot cast spells while shapeshifted, so my mobility would be greatly reduced because I couldn't teleport. It's just not worth it any way I look at it.

Using summoning magic is out of the question as well, since none of these spells were designed to fight an enemy of this caliber. The most any of the summoned creatures could do is moderately inconvenience Tyrath or provide a distraction.

Maybe I'm thinking in too small of a scale, though. With the powers I have at my disposal right now, I could be doing a lot more damage. I could literally make a tornado out of thin air, or use earth magic to animate a rock giant that would dwarf the dragon and who could smash him between its hands. I could also make a blizzard, a lightning storm, a rain of acid and even a rain of meteorites. 

The problem with all of these big spells is that it's almost impossible to prevent collateral damage, so I'd be forced to cast a lot of protections on Daren, Kate, Rose and even myself  beforehand to make sure we're all safe, which would take me about a minute. The time freezing spell wouldn't save me much time in this case, since we're relatively far apart from each other, and moving would cancel the time stopping effect.

Half a minute of my time is already up. I'll need to decide fast.


[44]I mimic his earlier move and clap my hands, which creates an incredibly strong blast of air in front of me, sending the dragon back about fifty feet. 

"I don't know how you were able to see through my illusion, human, but I'm not going to take it easy on you anymore."

After finishing his phrase, the dragon immediately appears in front of me and swings one of his claws at my chest. It was all I could do to teleport out of harm's way in time, with a short range spell suited for combat. 

The dragon and I spend the next few seconds teleporting one after the other and trying to take each  other by surprise.

Damn it! If only I could cast my big spells now, I'd make short work of him. I think I can still make it if I go and cast the protection spells on the others right now.

[46]As Tyrath flies towards me, I swing my sword at him, which unleashes a powerful lightning attack that hits him head on. That doesn't affect the dragon in the slightest and when he reaches me, he attacks me with his claws again. 

I teleport out of his range, and try to think fast of what my next move should be. Fire doesn't work, lightning doesn't work, ice doesn't work either and I don't see how powering this sword with air, water or earth would do any good. That only leaves acid as an option, but the question is, will the acid get absorbed into the sword like all the other elements, or will it completely melt through the metal?

There's only one way to find out.


[47]I let go of the lava that's rotating around me, and shoot a beam of lightning out of my hands, big enough to engulf the whole dragon in it. This does not stop Tyrath from his flight, and I'm forced to again teleport out of his way when he reaches me. Lightning doesn't work either. If he can melt rock that easily, then he'll have no trouble against water. What the hell am I supposed to use against him? Acid?

I surround the dragon with a sphere of acid, and I try to envelop him in it. Tyrath lets out a much more powerful roar than before. So powerful, in fact that it creates an explosion of air all around him, and sends my acid flying all over the place. His roar was so loud that I had to use a spell to avoid losing consciousness. I can only hope that Daren and the others have access to sonic protection as well. 

"Insolent wretch!" the dragon screams. "There won't be a single speck of dust left of you when I'm finished!"

Tyrath starts teleporting for me again, but this time he's doing it faster. I can barely keep up with him anymore. What the hell am I doing? I am in control of more magical power than I ever dreamed would be possible, but I can't hold off a single dragon?!

[49]I throw the fire back towards Tyrath, and cast acid on the sword once more. I teleport next to him again, and I strike at him with my acid empowered sword. He blocks my attack with one of his claws, but the sword still goes through his thick skin. 

The dragon spends the next minute on the defensive, teleporting away from my attacks and shooting fire at me, while I try to anticipate his moves and teleport after him. He manages to dodge most of my attacks, but the few strikes that hit him are  causing him quite a bit of damage. At this rate I won't have any trouble finishing him by the time I run out of magic.


[50]Even though he managed to get out, it's clear that Tyrath has taken a lot of damage from my last attack. He's now breathing fire hotter than ever before, engulfing my rock giant in flames and turning him into molten lava.

Try all you want, little dragon, but you won't escape my grasp. Nothing can stop me now. 

Dozens of volcanoes are starting to erupt from the earth below as I use even more magical power, this time to call upon a rain of acid. The dragon screams as the acid burns through its wings, and he starts to desperately shoot fire everywhere above him, in order to burn all of the acid before it reaches him. I teleport next to Tyrath and point my palms towards him,  blowing him away with a powerful explosion of air that stuns him for a few seconds. Since I've interrupted him from burning the drops of acid, the rain is now once more pouring on him, and the dragon starts to scream in pain again.

It's over. He's no match for me. The time I have left will be more than enough to finish him off for good.

[52]No! Not now! I was going to finish this. I was winning! I'm nowhere near my five minutes limit. How did I expend all of my magical energy in just a few seconds? Was it because of the sudden power up I got just now?

Please, it can't all end like this. I just need to deliver one more strike. One more strike is all I need. Please...

It's too late. I can't even maintain my flight spell anymore. I'm falling. There's no way I'll survive a fall from this height. Daren and Kate are too far to help me. Is this it for me? After all that's happened, am I simply going to die pathetically like this?

Just before I reach the ground, I suddenly stop in mid-air and then I fall flat on my face, from a height of about three feet. How did I do that? Did I manage to gather my last few drops of power in order to save myself?

"How disappointing," I hear Eiden's voice from high above in the sky. "How very disappointing. Barry, I was expecting a lot more from you. I didn't give you all of that magical energy just so you could waste it by activating your device's temporary maximized mode."

[54]"Eiden..." the dragon says, as he gets up and soars into the air again. "I've been looking for you." 

The stillwater smiles.

"Tyrath! It feels like it's been a century since I last saw you! Or has it really been that long? I don't remember. Come give your old friend a hug!"

"I was going to bait you out using the bodies of your lackeys, but it looks like that is no longer necessary. Today we end this, once and for all."

"Come now, Tyrath! Don't be so melodramatic. You're ruining our happy reunion!"

Instead of replying, the dragon blasts Eiden with his fire breath. The stillwater points his finger at the flames, and they stop in front of him. He then gestures towards the dragon with his hand, and the flames head back towards Tyrath, hitting him head on.

"I see you're still up to your old tricks," the dragon says. "But I've become a lot more powerful since you left. This won't be like the last time."

[56]"Do you understand now, Barry? The energy I gave you was never meant to be used like that. Magical energy doesn't grow on trees, you know? You should use it with more care."

"Eiden..." the dragon says, as he gets up and soars into the air again. "I've been looking for you." 

The stillwater smiles.

"Tyrath! It feels like it's been a century since I last saw you! Or has it really been that long? I don't remember. Come give your old friend a hug!"

[57]"What is the meaning of this?" the dragon asks.

"Has it been so long you've forgotten, old friend?" Eiden says. "Just because they haven't been activated in more than a millennia does not mean these traps are out of function. This one was just a bit out of tune, that's all. So I had to warm it up before it would start working again!"

"You can't mean..."

Eiden's smile widens.

"The lessathi have many flaws, but poor craftsmanship is not one of them. Most of the artifacts they built in the old times are still fully functional after all!"

As the two of them speak, the ground is shaking violently, and the blue light is intensifying.

"Listen to me, stillwater. Your little tricks won't last forever. This won't keep me away for long. And when I get out, you're going to wish you were never born. Do you hear me?! Wipe that smile off your face, you lowborn little--"

All of the magic in the air gets unleashed in a single moment, and the dragon gets teleported away, as the blue light disappears and the earthquake slowly stops.

Eiden turns back to me.

"I hope you won't miss him too much. It'll be a while before we see him again."


[58]"You'll... pay for this... Both of you... I will not rest until I hunt you down. Nowhere on this continent will be safe for you ever again. Do you hear me?! I will hunt you down! Wipe that smile off your face, you lowborn little--"

All of the magic in the air gets unleashed in a single moment, and the dragon gets teleported away, as the blue light disappears and the earthquake slowly stops. The energy from my device is gone. I could sense it disappear the moment the dragon was teleported away.

Eiden turns back to me.

"Well done, Barry! You have far exceeded my expectations!"

"Well done, Barry! I'll be honest with you, I was hoping you'd be using more spectacular spells in this skirmish, but I cannot blame you for wanting to be efficient!"

[61]"He, uh..."

She pauses.

"He said that he couldn't let the dragon win, after having gloated like a villain from a children's storybook..."

"Well, there you have it. But never mind Eiden's intentions. What I am most interested in knowing is how you both got to interact with him in the middle of our fight, when neither me nor Daren saw him appear until the end of the battle."

"He froze time," I tell her.

"Froze time?!" Daren asks, perplexed. "How is that even possible?"

"Beats me. He just snapped his fingers and made time stop for everyone except me and him."

"Wait,  what about Rose?" Kate asks.

"He said... that I was able to resist his spell because I'm a time weaver," Rose answers her.

"What the hell is a time weaver?" Kate says.


[62]"He, uh..."

She pauses.

"What the hell is a time weaver?" Kate says.


[64]"I'm sorry, Kate," Daren says, as he finishes his spell. "This is all I can do for you. Your wounds were just too deep to heal completely."

Looking at Kate, I can see that Daren has healed most of the damage made by the dragon's fire, but the left side of her face is still lightly scarred. Surprisingly, it does not look bad on her. Kate, after all, never really had a very feminine look to begin with. Her beauty was always more feral in nature, and her newly acquired scars complement it nicely. 

"It's no problem," Kate tells Daren while looking at her face through a mirror made of ice. "Most people were already calling me a monster and running away when they first saw me. At least now they'll have a legitimate reason for it."

[66]Kate suddenly stops in her tracks, and looks straight at me. The look in her eyes slowly turns into one of both sheer terror and sudden understanding. Then, her look becomes dark. Darker than I've ever seen it before, as she continues to look me straight in the eyes.

"Almost as if I were a... what?"

"Never mind. It wasn't important. Let's catch up with the others, we're lagging behind again."

The tone in her voice was as cold as her freezing magic. She does not say another word to me, and goes to catch up with Daren and Rose. 

Great. Just what we needed. More underlying conflict in our group. I'm sure this can only end well for everyone.
