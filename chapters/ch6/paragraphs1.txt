"Alright, I think that's a wrap!" says Daren once we finish our strategy meeting. 

We're currently all sitting in a circle in front of our cave's entrance. The sun is pretty high up in the sky, and there's not a cloud in sight. Luckily, Kate has graciously agreed to use her ice magic to cool the air around us a bit. This way we can enjoy the weather without feeling as if we were inside an oven. 

"Noon is almost upon us," Daren continues. "We should get going as soon as possible. We can't afford to keep travelling once the sun sets, and we have a long road ahead of us. Rose, did you get all of the herbs you were looking for?"

"Oh, no... I just remembered, I dropped my bag of herbs when I was being chased by the goblins."

"Don't worry, I doubt anyone would have stolen it, so it must still be where you left it. I'll help you look for it! Come with me."

I get up to follow them, but Kate grabs me by the sleeve.


[323]"Maybe a little," I tell her.

"You were?! I thought he was just joking! I'm... sorry, I don't mean to hurt your feelings, but I'm not... interested right now."

"I said only a little. What's gotten into you all of a sudden? This isn't like you."

Kate looks away, takes a deep breath and exhales before she continues.

"When those three mages attacked us earlier, it made me realize something. You and Rose are the only persons I've ever met that did not treat me like some kind of monster. Even if people don't always say it openly like those three mages did, there's something in their eyes that gives them away. Something that makes it clear that they do not see me as human. It's the same with Daren. Despite what you've said, I don't think he truly believes I'm not a banshee. I think it's only a matter of time before I'll have to fight him, just like I've had to fight everyone else."

I guess she's starting to see through my lie already. I was hoping I could convince her to not lose her trust in Daren, but it seems she never really had much trust in him to begin with.


[324]"Of course not. Daren was just joking earlier. Don't worry about it."

Kate sighs with relief.

"I was hoping that were the case," she says.

"What's gotten into you all of a sudden? This isn't like you."

Kate looks away, takes a deep breath and exhales before she continues.

[325]"Yeah, Kate was just about to profess her love for me."

Kate makes a long sword of ice materialize in her hand and she presses its tip lightly against my throat.

"Say that again. I dare you."

"See, now you're acting more like yourself! All jokes aside, I think Daren has a point. The sooner we leave here, the better. Let's get going."

Kate takes her sword out of my face and makes it vanish, while Daren and I head for the cave to make sure we're not forgetting anything.


[326]"No, you're right, we should get going."

Daren looks like he'd have a few more questions for us, but he decides to let it drop for now, and we both head for the cave to make sure we're not forgetting anything.


[327]Before leaving, I make sure to take with me my spoils of war from this morning's skirmishes: a crossbow from one of the crossbowmen who ambushed us and a few daggers from Cutthroat Dave's men.

We join back with Rose, and we set off on our long road ahead. 

Shortly after we begin our trip, Daren notices that I've strapped my crossbow to the back of my backpack.

"Barry, why aren't you just putting that crossbow inside the backpack, like you did with everything else?"

"Well, because it's already full with all my other stuff."

"Full? Wait a minute, Barry, you're telling me that the backpack you are carrying with you right now is actually a completely regular one?"

"Well, yeah, enchanted backpacks are really hard to come by if you're not a mage."

[329]Just as we reach the cave's entrance, we see Molan, the deer fawn, jumping up and down, looking very excited.

"Mommy, mommy, come quick! It's aunt Rose! Aunt Rose came to visit us!"

Rose's usual warm smile perished from her face when she saw the deer fawn and was replaced by a sad expression in her eyes. 

"Rose?" says Elaria as she exits the cave. "Rose, is that you?"

"Yes..." Rose answers in the deer's language, not bringing herself to look her in the eyes. "It's been a while."

"It has. We haven't seen you in months. And you used to visit us so often. Rose, you know you'll always be welcome in our home, right?"

"I know... I'm sorry, I have to go now."

"Aunt Rose, you're not staying?" the deer fawn asks her.

"Don't worry, little one," Elaria tells her son. "I'm sure she'll come back and stay longer when she'll be ready. She must have something important to do. You know how she is, always busy helping people."

[331]I decide that it's better to leave her alone. I doubt that anything I would say could make her feel any better.

Shortly after we begin our trip, Daren notices that I've strapped my crossbow to the back of my backpack.

"Barry, why aren't you just putting that crossbow inside the backpack, like you did with everything else?"

"Well, because it's already full with all my other stuff."

"Well, yeah, enchanted backpacks are really hard to come by if you're not a mage."


[332]"Hey, I've been meaning to ask, how did you and Elaria meet? You seemed to know each other quite well."

My question took Rose by surprise. She must have realized she wasn't acting like herself because she immediately regained her smile when she started answering me.

"Oh, I met Elaria and Molan a few years ago when I was out collecting herbs. Molan was very sick and I helped make an ointment to cure his illness. We've been friends ever since."

"And then something happened?"

Rose's smile remained on her face, but her eyes started to show a bit of sadness.

"It was that obvious, huh? Yes, something happened, although it wasn't something that Elaria or I did. A few months ago, after the death of our grand priest, people started to get desperate. Our last reserves of food were dwindling and it wasn't long before only the rich had access to any kind of conjured food that remained. Animal hunting became more and more popular, and a war between the animals and the humans was inevitable. The war has cost us many lives, including Molan's father. Ever since he died, I couldn't bring myself to look either of them in the eyes again. That's why I haven't visited them for so long."


[333]"Hey, I've been meaning to ask, did something happen between you and Elaria?"

My question took Rose by surprise. She must have realized she wasn't acting like herself, because she tried to feign her usual smile. She didn't really pull it off very well, because even though her mouth was smiling, her eyes were still showing sadness.

[334]"It wasn't your fault"

"I know. There's nothing I could have done. I don't even know who killed him. I just know that the killer was someone from my hometown. But I still feel terrible."


[335]"That's stupid. You weren't the one who killed him."

Rose gives off a soft chuckle. 

"Comforting speeches aren't really your thing, are they, Barry?"

"I'm afraid not. But at least I got you to laugh, so it can't have been all that bad, right?"

"No, you were the worst," Rose says, smiling. "Come on, we're lagging behind. Let's catch up with Daren."

Shortly after we begin our trip, Daren notices that I've strapped my crossbow to the back of my backpack.

"Barry, why aren't you just putting that crossbow inside the backpack, like you did with everything else?"

"Well, because it's already full with all my other stuff."


[336]"Elaria didn't seem to mind your presence. Personally, I think you're only making things worse by deciding to not visit them."

"I guess... I guess you're right. After seeing how they reacted when they saw me, I realize now that it might have been selfish of me to cut the ties with them just like that. I should have stuck by them in their time of need. Next time I visit them, it will be different. Thank you, Barry, for setting me straight!"

Her warm smile is back on her face, and this time it looks like it's sincere. 

"You're welcome," I tell her, as we end our conversation and continue on our way.

Kate seems to have caught some of our conversation, because she is smiling at me faintly.

[338]"Maybe it would indeed be better to keep your distance for now."

"Yeah. I suppose you're right. But thank you, Barry, I'm feeling a little better now that I've talked to someone about it."

Her warm smile is back on her face, and this time it looks like it's sincere. 

"You're welcome," I tell her, as we end our conversation and continue on our way.

Shortly after we begin our trip, Daren notices that I've strapped my crossbow to the back of my backpack.

"Well, because it's already full with all my other stuff."

"Full? Wait a minute, Barry, you're telling me that the backpack you are carrying with you right now is actually a completely regular one?"


[339]"Secure it. Better to be safe than sorry."

"As you wish."

Once he's done enchanting my backpack, he hands it back to me and then turns to Rose.

"I can see you're very interested in my craft. Would you perhaps like to have your backpack enchanted as well?"

Rose blushes, realizing she'd been a bit too obvious in her curiosity.

"I would be honored!" she answers.

Once he's done with her backpack too, we continue on our way.

We spent the next few hours travelling south, taking the most direct route available to Rose's town. Her usual route was designed to avoid most areas that are known to be frequented by monsters, but Daren insisted on delivering the cure to the sick as soon as possible, and said that our group should be more than able to handle a few monster attacks.

The scenery that we've seen during our travel has been rather underwhelming. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I always thought that the fabled continent of Varathia would be filled with all sorts of natural wonders and mythical creatures. All I've seen today were your everyday pine and oak forests, with a lake or a river here and there to keep it from becoming completely monotonous. At least it's been a few hours since the last time we've been attacked, which is quite an achievement, judging by how this tournament has been going so far. 


[340]"Secure it. Better to be safe than sorry."

"I would be honored!" she answers.

Once he's done with her backpack too, Daren turns to me, with a very excited look on his face.

"Barry, I just realized something. Remember how I said that we'd have to travel all the way to a city in order to find a local you could attack so that you'd get sent home? Well, we don't need to do that anymore! Now we've got Rose."

I hadn't thought of that. How did I not think of that? I should have known this would happen the moment we'd met her.

"No, I couldn't. Even if it means getting back home, I can't just attack Rose like that." 

"You don't need to worry about that," Rose says, smiling. "I'd be glad to help! And besides, we already know the spell would stop you before actually touching me thanks to that mage that attacked me this morning."


[342]"Secure it. Better to be safe than sorry."

"As you wish."

Once he's done enchanting my backpack, he hands it back to me and then turns to Rose.

"I would be honored!" she answers.

Once he's done with her backpack too, Daren turns to me, with a very excited look on his face.

"Barry, I just realized something. Rose is a herbalist! She can help you find the plants you need to cure your sister! I bet she knows this continent in and out when it comes to medicinal herbs."

"Uh, I don't think--"

"Barry, your sister is ill?" Rose asks me, concerned. "I'm so sorry to hear that. What kind of herbs are you looking for, exactly?"

"I'm, uh... looking for a kind of plant that has long leaves with crenate margins, and little purple fruit with white spots."

"I know of the plants you're talking about but... those aren't medicinal herbs. They're used to make a kind of tea. Are you sure you aren't mistaken?"


[343]"No, leave it like that. It's secure enough as it is."

"As you wish."

Once he's done enchanting my backpack, he hands it back to me and then turns to Rose.

"I can see you're very interested in my craft. Would you perhaps like to have your backpack enchanted as well?"

"I know of the plants you're talking about but... those aren't medicinal herbs. They're used to make a kind of tea. Are you sure you aren't mistaken?"


[347]"I wasn't going to. I just kind of figured I'd manage to wing it until the end of the tournament."

"I see," Daren says.

He then walks past me, and does not say another word.

"Oh no, did I say something I shouldn't have?" Rose asks Kate.

"No, this is entirely Barry's fault. Don't worry about it."

We spent the next few hours travelling south, taking the most direct route available to Rose's town.

"I see," Daren says.

He then walks past me, and does not say another word.

"Oh no, did I say something I shouldn't have?" Rose asks Kate.

"No, this is entirely Barry's fault. Don't worry about it."


[349]"I'm sorry, I meant to tell you sooner, but I was afraid you'd get upset."

"So you figured that the best way to go at it was to keep lying to me?"

"No, it's--"

"I've heard enough. Let's keep moving. We shouldn't be wasting any more time."

He then walks past me, and does not say another word.

"Oh no, did I say something I shouldn't have?" Rose asks Kate.

"No, this is entirely Barry's fault. Don't worry about it."

We spent the next few hours travelling south, taking the most direct route available to Rose's town. Her usual route was designed to avoid most areas that are known to be frequented by monsters, but Daren insisted on delivering the cure to the sick as soon as possible, and said that our group should be more than able to handle a few monster attacks.

The scenery that we've seen during our travel has been rather underwhelming. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I always thought that the fabled continent of Varathia would be filled with all sorts of natural wonders and mythical creatures. All I've seen today were your everyday pine and oak forests, with a lake or a river here and there to keep it from becoming completely monotonous. At least it's been a few hours since the last time we've been attacked, which is quite an achievement, judging by how this tournament has been going so far.

[351]"I'm sorry, I should have told you the truth from the beginning."

"Yes, you should have," Daren says.

He then walks past me, and does not say another word.

[353]Kate has opened up a bit since her last discussion with me. When we first met yesterday, she looked very tense, and it seemed as though she was expecting us to try and kill her the moment she turns her back on us. Now she seems calmer, and she allows herself to smile a little more often, even if only faintly, especially when she's talking with Rose. 

We've been keeping a steady pace so far, and there's been no breaks except for occasionally stopping to get some fruits from the trees, or to fill our gourds with water from a river. During one of these small breaks, Rose approached me in private to ask me about the discussion I had with Kate this morning.

"Barry, I've been meaning to ask, did we actually interrupt an important discussion between you and Kate this morning? Kate's been acting evasive every time I brought up the subject. I'd feel terrible if you two lost the chance to confess your feelings for each other because Daren and I couldn't read the mood."

Now she seems calmer, and she allows herself to smile a little more often, even if only faintly, especially when she's talking with Rose. 

Daren, on the other hand has not said a single word to me ever since we started our journey. He must still be upset because I lied to him about my true reasons for being here.

I can only hope that he won't be like this for the rest of our trip. Rose tried several times to get the two of us to talk to each other, but the most that she managed to get out of Daren were short and concise answers to her questions, nothing more.

Daren, on the other hand has not said a single word to me ever since we started our journey. His words from this morning are still ringing in my ears: "I feel like I don't even know you anymore."

I can only hope that he won't be like this for the rest of our trip. Rose tried several times to get the two of us to talk to each other, but the most that she managed to get out of Daren were short and concise answers to her questions, nothing more.

Daren on the other hand has been a lot colder with me ever since he found out that I lied about my true intentions for coming here. We're still on speaking terms, but he's nowhere near as friendly as he was yesterday. I can only hope that he'll get over it by the end of our trip.

[357]"Don't worry, that wasn't what our discussion was about."

"Oh?" Rose says, in a manner that suggests she doesn't really believe me. "Well, if both you and Kate say nothing happened, then I won't insist anymore! Come on, we should help the others with picking fruits. We'll need all the food we can get for the long journey ahead of us." 


[358]"Actually, I prefer women with larger breasts like yourself."

Rose chuckles.

"Oh my, how bold!" she says. "I'm curious, did this line ever work for you in the past?"


[359]"I'm still available, if that's what you're asking."

Rose smiles.

"That's not what I was asking, but it does answer my question. I doubt you'd be making a pass at me like this if there were actually something between you and Kate. As for your advances, I'm not married, so I have no reason to outright turn you down before I get to know you, but I'd rather we postpone this conversation until a later date. Does that sound okay to you?"


[360]"You've got it all wrong! My only feelings are for you."

"Oh my, how flattering! Although, I'm not exactly sure how seriously I can take someone who announces his feelings for me a mere few hours after we've first met. Perhaps we should take this a bit slower? Get to know each other first?"


[361]"Don't worry, we got to say all we needed before you interrupted."

"Oh?" Rose says, smiling. "I'm beginning to understand why Kate was avoiding the subject, then. I'm glad that the two of you are being honest with each other. I won't ask any more questions, if that's the case. However, I will tell you this: I've only known Kate for a few hours, but I can tell that she's been through a lot. So please, try not to hurt her. She has a good heart."

"I'll... keep that in mind."

Rose smiles.

"Now then, I think we should start helping the others with picking fruits. We'll need all the food we can get for the long journey ahead of us."


[362]"Actually, you're the one that stunned me with your beauty when I first saw you."

"Oh... Thank you for the compliment, but I thought--"

"There's nothing going on between me and Kate. In fact, the purpose of our discussion this morning was to clear things up between us, because of Daren's joke that I was smitten with her."

"I see. I guess I misunderstood the situation, then. Listen, about what you said earlier, I don't--"

"There's no need to say anything. I wasn't making a pass at you, I was just being sincere. I barely even know you besides the fact that you seem really nice and kind. I think we should continue this conversation after we've known each other a little better."

Rose smiles.

"Yeah, we should do that!"

She pauses.

"I think we should go help the others with picking fruits. We'll need all the food we can get for the long journey ahead of us."


[363]"Every single time."

Rose smiles.

"Then you must have enjoyed quite the high quality of female companionship in your life! Sadly, I won't be joining their ranks. I do owe you for saving me this morning, however, so I'll be doing you the favor of pretending this conversation never happened. Now come, we should help the others with picking fruits. We'll need all the food we can get for the long journey ahead of us." 


[364]"Not really."

She laughs softly again.

"Well then, I hope it won't hurt your self-esteem too much if I politely decline your advances! Now come, we should help the others with picking fruits. We'll need all the food we can get for the long journey ahead of us." 


[365]"Of course."

"Good!" Rose says, still smiling. "Now come, we should help the others with picking fruits. We'll need all the food we can get for the long journey ahead of us." 


[366]"I want my answer now!"

"Well, now, aren't we impatient? It almost makes me think that you have reasons to believe I will begin to dislike you once I get to know you better. Is there something I should know about, Barry?"

"...No."

"Then I'm sure you can afford to wait a few more days for my answer! Now come, we should help the others with picking fruits. We'll need all the food we can get for the long journey ahead of us." 


[367]"Maybe you're right. I'm sorry for getting ahead of myself."

Rose smiles.

"There's no need to apologize! I'm sure we'll have more than a few opportunities to get to know each other during our journey. At any rate, I think I got the answer I needed for my first question. After hearing you say something like that, I very much doubt that there's something between you and Kate, so I'm glad we really didn't interrupt anything important this morning. Now come, we should help the others with picking fruits. We'll need all the food we can get for the long journey ahead of us." 


[368]"I cannot wait any longer. My heart burns with passion for you!"
  
Rose immediately bursts into laughter upon hearing my love declaration. 

"Oh, gods," she says, as she tries to contain herself. "I'm so sorry! It's just that you sound exactly like my ex husband. He used to say the craziest things!"


[369]"But did he mean it like I do?"

"I do not know! It's really hard to take anything seriously when it's spoken like that."

She smiles.

"But I'll keep that in mind for now. Please, allow me some time to clear my thoughts. We will get ample opportunities to continue this conversation during our trip. At any rate, I think I got the answer I needed for my first question. After hearing you say something like that, I very much doubt that there's something between you and Kate, so I'm glad we really didn't interrupt anything important this morning. Now come, we should help the others with picking fruits. We'll need all the food we can get for the long journey ahead of us." 


[370]"Ex husband?"

"Yes, I was married for a few years, but it didn't really work out in the end. We both moved on with our lives since our breakup, and we had no children so you don't need to worry about that."

She smiles.

"I'm sorry for reacting the way I did, but this was all very sudden for me. Please, allow me some time to clear my thoughts. We will get ample opportunities to continue this conversation during our trip. At any rate, I think I got the answer I needed for my first question. After hearing you say something like that, I very much doubt that there's something between you and Kate, so I'm glad we really didn't interrupt anything important this morning. Now come, we should help the others with picking fruits. We'll need all the food we can get for the long journey ahead of us." 


[371]Rose and I join the others, and once we're all done gathering provisions, we depart once more. As we travel, we start talking about various things: Daren's adventures, our lives before joining the tournament, the reasons we all came here. During our conversations, Daren was of course the one that's been speaking the most, while Kate has been as evasive as always about her past and her reasons for being here. Hearing our stories, Rose decides to join our discussion, by telling us a bit about herself.

"I've always liked plants," she tells us. "Plants and books. So it's no surprise that I spent most of my youth with my nose buried in herbology manuals. As time passed, I started to learn more about herbal medicine, and I realized my talents could be used to help the people in need. Most people I help don't really have much money to repay me, but the little they give me is enough for me to make a living, and their sincere feelings of gratitude are much more rewarding to me than the money I'd get by only working for rich folk. I've been living a modest life along with my brother and sister who are nine and eight years old respectively, and ever since my father died last year, I've been occasionally getting some financial support from my ex husband."

"You were married?" Daren asks.

"Yes, for a few years, but it didn't really work out in the end. We've both moved on with our lives since then, and we've had no children together, so there were no hard feelings. Ever since my father died, I've had to take care of my siblings all by myself, so my main focus for the past year has been my work, and my family."

"But what about your mother?" says Kate.


[372]"Are monster raids frequent in your area?"

"Yes, monsters have been getting bolder in the past few decades. It's not just in our area, it happens throughout the entire continent. I'm not certain, but I think it all started when we lost contact with the animal kingdom. After the first animal hunts were started by the people of Olmnar several decades ago, the animals' leader, the spirit golden fox has ordered her subjects to stop speaking in our language. The monsters must have found out about this, and they took advantage of the fact that the humans and the animals were no longer working together in order to wreak havoc."

"What about the gods?" Daren asks. "Are they not getting involved in any of this?"

"The only gods that are currently getting involved are the god of Fate and the god of Death, but I very much doubt that any of them have our best interests at heart. It is said that the two of them started working together recently, and that might well be true, judging by the high level of cooperation between their followers lately."

"Wait, isn't the god of Fate just a fancy title for the god of Illusions?" Daren says.

"Yes," Rose answers. "Most gods name themselves after the power their followers gain by worshipping them. Some of them, however choose other names for themselves, which can be a bit confusing. It's the same for the god of Death. Judging by his name, you would think that he reigns over the underworld, but in fact he is just a god of Necromancy, bringing the dead back to life to serve his bidding."


[373]"Why aren't the people rebelling against the nobles?"

"Some of them are, but the nobles are backed up by royalty, so most people don't dare to openly oppose them. In our town, the rebels are almost inexistent, but I hear that in some cities with a similar situation to ours there are full-blown civil wars going."

"What about the gods?" Daren asks. "Are they not getting involved in any of this?"

"The only gods that are currently getting involved are the god of Fate and the god of Death, but I very much doubt that any of them have our best interests at heart. It is said that the two of them started working together recently, and that might well be true, judging by the high level of cooperation between their followers lately."

It's the same for the god of Death. Judging by his name, you would think that he reigns over the underworld, but in fact he is just a god of Necromancy, bringing the dead back to life to serve his bidding."


[374]As Rose talks, I hear three loud beeps coming from my pocket. I pull out my stat device, and am surprised to see that the maximum numbers for my stats have now been increased to four.

"What's that?" Rose asks.

"It's a toy," Daren says before I get a chance to reply. "You know those magical devices that simulate a pet in order to teach little kids about responsibilities? Those beeps you heard were Barry's pet getting hungry."

"Oh, I love those toys! Ever since I got one for my little sister I just couldn't keep her apart from it!"

"Ignore Daren," Kate says. "He was just being a smartass. What Barry has there is a stat booster. He's using it to harness magical energy from the air which he can then use to augment his physical abilities."

Rose looks impressed.

"Wow, I did not know such a thing was possible. So that device is basically turning you into a mage?"


[375]As Rose talks, I hear three loud beeps coming from my pocket. I pull out my stat device, and am surprised to see that the maximum numbers for my stats have now been increased to four.

"What's that?" Rose asks.

I was half expecting Daren to butt in and make fun of my stat booster before I get a chance to reply, but then I remembered he must still be upset at me for lying to him. I never thought I'd actually start to miss his sarcastic remarks.

"It's a stat device. It harnesses magical energy from the air which I can then use to augment my physical abilities."

Rose looks impressed.

"Wow, I did not know such a thing was possible. So that device is basically turning you into a mage?"

I never thought about it this way. It's true that there are some mages that actually use their magic to augment their powers, in a similar way that this device does. Does that make me one of them?

"I suppose..." I answer her. "But it's only temporary. The device will run out of energy once I'm no longer surrounded by all these powerful mages to extract it from."

I take a look at my stat booster and start to think of what I should spend my newly acquired points on.


[376]As I finish using my device, Rose asks me another question.

"Wait, so if your stat booster extracts magical energy from other mages, does that mean it's also eating away at Daren and Kate's powers?"

"It's getting a bit of energy from every mage in a thirty mile radius, but the amount it takes from each of them is barely enough to mildly inconvenience them. Most of the energy it's getting is from the powerful spells that have been cast all around us since the beginning of this tournament, and that energy would have just dissipated into thin air anyway, so you could just say I'm recycling it, rather than stealing it. I think that--"

I get interrupted by a very loud roar that echoes all around us. 

"What was that?" Rose asks, visibly scared.

A second, louder roar now booms through the air, as I can feel my hair stand up on the back of my neck. I've never heard this sound before in my life. I have no idea what beast might be causing it. So then what is this feeling of dread I'm getting all of a sudden? Why do I find myself wanting to run as fast as I can, in any direction, as long as it gets me as far away from this place as possible?


[377]"If you're talking about Eiden, he left this morning." 

"I asked you where he is, not when he left, you stupid lowly creature."

"We don't know where he went, he didn't tell us."

"Then you are useless to me."

The dragon growls before it continues.

"I should have known that I'd be wasting my time by trying to communicate with the likes of you. If only that stillwater would have minded his own business after he returned to the continent instead of writing that accursed message in the sky, I'd have left him be. But he had the incredible nerve to involve the dragon hunters in all of this?"

"Wait, we're not dragon hunters. Please, if you could just let us explain--"

"Silence, mongrel! I've watched your pathetic human race fumble their way through life ever since they stopped walking on four legs. I could have killed or enslaved you all at any point in your miserable existence, if it weren't beneath me. But now your kind dares to rise against me? Your charred remains will serve as my gift for Eiden, to welcome him back to my realm."

The dragon soars to the sky, as it shouts its final words to us.

"Pray to your gods, humans! They're the only ones that can save you from the onslaught that will follow."


[378]"If you're talking about Eiden, he left this morning." 

"I asked you where he is, not when he left, you stupid lowly creature."

"We don't know where he went, he didn't tell us."

"Then you are useless to me."

"I should have known that I'd be wasting my time by trying to communicate with the likes of you. If only that stillwater would have minded his own business after he returned to the continent instead of writing that accursed message in the sky, I'd have left him be."

I suddenly remember the message that was written in the stars last night. That was Eiden's doing?

"Wait, so you actually do know the location of the Magium?"

The dragon stops, and he eyes me for a few seconds before he continues.

"So you're a dragon hunter, then."

"Wait, what?..."


[379]"We're not working with him, we only just met him a few hours ago."

"Lies. What reason would he have had to leave you alive if he didn't have a use for you?"

"I, uh... Well, he did ask us to deliver a message for him."

"A message?"

The dragon laughs.

"I see he's reduced himself to using lowborn mongrels to do his menial tasks nowadays. If you're just lowly messengers, then you are useless to me."

The dragon growls before it continues.

"I should have known that I'd be wasting my time by trying to communicate with the likes of you.

"Wait, what?..."


[381]"Why are you looking for him?"

"You dare question me??? I should rip off your head for your insolence, you little wretch."

"Uh, I was only curious, I didn't mean any offense. We don't know where he went, he never told us."

"Then you are useless to me."

The dragon growls before it continues.

"Wait, what?..."


[383]Kate launches several hundred sharp ice blades towards the dragon, but they simply bounce off its armored scales. 

"Kate!" Daren shouts from the distance. "Can you-- NGHHH--- Can you make a slide for me?"

"Yes," Kate shouts back, as she quickly builds an ice slide that starts below him and ends on the ground next to us. Once he sees the slide finished, Daren furiously thrusts his sword into the dragon's claw, as it starts to scream in pain and drops him right on the slide that's been custom made for him. 

Just as Daren finishes sliding down, the dragon uses his fire breath again, this time aiming directly for Kate. She makes a large thick shield of ice float above her in order to provide her cover. As the flames and the ice clash, I can see that Kate is making a great effort to keep the fire back. 

Daren quickly rushes to her position and provides her with cover before her ice melts away. Unfortunately, the fight has weakened him as well, and he does not manage to hold the barrier for long. His barrier breaks, and his shield drops to the ground, right when the dragon finishes its attack. The explosion of air generated by the destruction of Daren's barrier sent Rose flying, and she hit her head on a rock. She is now lying on the ground, motionless.

Think, Barry. Think. What can you do to turn the tide? There has to be something. There has to be a way to use everything you know to your advantage. There has to be a way. Think!

Once he sees the slide finished, Daren furiously thrusts his sword into the dragon's claw, as it starts to scream in pain and drops him right on the slide that's been custom made for him. 

Casting so many spells one after the other has taken its toll on Kate, who still hadn't recovered fully after this morning's skirmish with the crossbowmen. She is breathing heavily, and her right hand is trembling.

Just as Daren finishes sliding down, the dragon uses his fire breath again, this time aiming directly for Kate. She makes a large thick shield of ice float above her in order to provide her cover.

As the flames and the ice clash, I can see Kate struggling to keep her shield intact, but it is too much for her, in her current state. The shield melts, and the flames engulf her entire left arm and half of her face. She starts to scream from the pain, but quickly stops herself, and uses ice to put out the fire. The flames have left a hideous red mark covering the whole left side of her face, but her resolve has not wavered. She looks more determined than ever.

She readies a new ice shield and prepares to block the dragon's next breath attack. 


[385]"Where have you been hiding all this time?"

"Now, now, Barry, is this any way to talk to your savior? To answer your question, I've been following this dragon for a while now. I've been masking my presence so that he couldn't find  me by using his sight, smell, hearing or magical sense. I've been watching your battle since it began and I must say, I am not very impressed."

"Are you kidding me? What do you expect me to do against a dragon?"

"How about using that device you're holding in your hand?"

"Yeah? And what would you have me do? Max my strength and punch him to death?"

"Um... excuse me... sir..."

Me and Eiden both turn around at the same time and see that Rose is standing up and looking at Eiden, confused.

"Um... Hi... My name is Rose. Are you a friend of Barry?"

Eiden furrows his brows, and makes a hand gesture towards Rose.


[386]"What did you do?"

"I'd say this should all be self explanatory. I've frozen time."

"Frozen ti-- How is that even possible?"

"There is no such thing as impossible, Barry. As long as you never stop believing in yourself, you can overcome any limits. Remember this advice!"

"Is this all a joke to you?"

"No, but your fight with the dragon was. I've been watching your battle since it began and I must say, I am not very impressed."

"Are you kidding me? What do you expect me to do against a dragon?"

"How about using that device you're holding in your hand?"

"Yeah? And what would you have me do? Max my strength and punch him to death?"

"Um... excuse me... sir..."

Eiden and I both turn around at the same time and see that Rose is standing up and looking at Eiden, confused.


[387]"Why did you save us?"

"I'll be honest with you, Barry, I never really liked one sided battles. It takes away all the fun when you already know who's going to win. I've been watching your fight since it began and I must say, I am not very impressed."

"Are you kidding me? What do you expect me to do against a dragon?"

"How about using that device you're holding in your hand?"

"Yeah? And what would you have me do? Max my strength and punch him to death?"

"Um... excuse me... sir..."

Me and Eiden both turn around at the same time and see that Rose is standing up and looking at Eiden, confused.

"Um... Hi... My name is Rose. Are you a friend of Barry?"


[388]"Good, then maybe you can finish off that dragon for us."

"No, Barry, YOU are going to finish off that dragon."

Eiden snaps his fingers and my stat device flies out of my hand and into his. The device then suddenly starts glowing and it looks like it's accumulating a massive amount of energy in a very short amount of time.

"Hey!!!"

"I realize this must all be very confusing for you, Barry, so I'm going to provide you with a little bit of context. The beast that just attacked you is Tyrath, the self proclaimed king of all dragons. The reason he's looking for me is because I wrote a message in the stars last night in an ancient language used primarily by dragon hunters. The message's purpose was to let all dragon hunters who entered this contest know that a dragon exists on this island, and to give them all a little extra incentive to hunt him down. I very much doubt that any of them will pose a realistic threat to him, but it will be fun to watch."

He finishes charging up my stat device and then hands it back to me. As I hold it in my hand, I can feel a powerful surge of magical energy run through me and flow through all of my body. 


[389]"What's a time weaver?"

"I could tell you, but, wouldn't you rather find out by yourself? Would you not rather live the thrill of unraveling this mystery on your own?

"No, thanks. I'm the kind of guy that always spoils the ending for himself before finishing a book."

"Fair enough. You see, Barry, a time weaver is a person with a natural talent for manipulating time. They are immune to all time affecting spells, they can freeze time, slow down time and even reverse it with enough practice. They also have a gift of seeing into the future, although it's more blurred visions than anything else. Time weavers are extremely rare, and are said to only appear at the dawn of a new age. They usually lead normal lives until their powers awaken suddenly. The last known appearance of a time weaver occurred some six hundred years ago."

For a moment, it seemed like time was starting to resume its course again. I could hear Daren's shouting, the dragon's roar, the wind blowing in my ear, and I could see the grass start moving. Then everything froze back again, as if nothing had happened.

"Time is running out, Barry," Eiden says. "The time freezing spell won't last much longer."

Eiden snaps his fingers and my stat device flies out of my hand and into his. The device then suddenly starts glowing and it looks like it's accumulating a massive amount of energy in a very short amount of time.


[390]"What's so special about being a stat device wielder?"

"It's more special than you think! You are one of the rare cases that can utilize this device to its full potential. Not many can boast such a feat. Allow me to demonstrate."

Eiden snaps his fingers and my stat device flies out of my hand and into his. The device then suddenly starts glowing and it looks like it's accumulating a massive amount of energy in a very short amount of time.

"Hey!!!"

"I realize this must all be very confusing for you, Barry, so I'm going to provide you with a little bit of context.

He finishes charging up my stat device and then hands it back to me. As I hold it in my hand, I can feel a powerful surge of magical energy run through me and flow through all of my body. 


[391]As Eiden vanishes completely, time is slowly starting to resume its course. I take the stillwater's advice and quickly conjure a protective barrier around Kate and Daren. It's amazing how natural this is feeling. It's as if I've been casting spells my entire life. Is this really the true power of my stat device?

Just as I finish casting my spell, time unfreezes itself and the dragon's fire hits my magical barrier head on. The flames then  disperse into the air, while Kate looks around her, shocked at the discovery of the newly formed barrier protecting her.

"Daren, did you..."

"No, it wasn't me. This barrier is leagues stronger than anything I could ever conjure. I don't know who did this."

"You!" the dragon Tyrath shouts from high above in the sky, while pointing at me. "You did this! It does not matter. All you've managed to achieve is to make yourself my next target. Prepare to die!"


[392]Having all these powers means nothing if I just sit here and let them go to waste. I'm going to have to improvise. First things first, I need to get out of this barrier without getting burnt to a crisp. 

I cast a spell to protect myself from fire, and then a spell that enables flight. I fly out of the barrier, and right through the scorching flames. It feels as if I were in an oven, but at least I'm not getting any visible burns. The dragon sees me fly through his fire and lets out an intimidating roar.  I position myself at the same level of height as him, a few dozen feet from where he's hovering and I stop in mid-air.

Let's try acid first. I make a ball of acid and send it flying towards the dragon. Tyrath claps his wings together, which generates a strong gust of wind that scatters the acid, and sends me spinning backwards. That disoriented me a bit, so it took me a few seconds to figure out where the dragon went. Once I locate him, I send a powerful jet of water in his direction. The dragon gets pushed back by the force of the impact, but aside from that, it does not look like he took any damage.


[393]Going in without a plan would be suicidal. I'll just have to use this time as efficiently as I can. First of all, I need to think about my defenses. I now have access to dozens of powerful protection spells, but it would take me three minutes to cast all of them. 

Even if I use the time freezing spell Eiden cast just now, that would still only save me about two minutes, and I'll become unable to use the spell for the remainder of the battle. Then again, the time stopping spell isn't really suited for combat, since the spell breaks as soon as I move a few feet or interact with anyone who's frozen, so this may well be the best time to use it. Or maybe I should try to limit casting to only what is absolutely necessary?

Let's see... The one thing I'll need the most is protection from fire. I can't just spend my whole fight trapped inside this barrier, and this spell will grant me some immunity from flames. It'll still feel like I'm in an oven, but at least I won't be burnt to a crisp. 

Aside from that, judging by how I've seen the dragon fight so far, I think I could also use some protection from physical damage, to defend me from his claw attacks. It won't be enough to stop him from killing me if he lands a strike, but maybe it'll help me deflect some of his hits.  


[394]The dragon sees that his fire breath isn't working, so he tries to dive in again. My barrier is too strong to be broken as easily as Daren's though, so he'll be busy for a while.

Now that I've established my defensive strategy, I need to think about the offensive. With the spells I have access to now, I have almost limitless choices, but I'll have to think of a tactic that can defeat Tyrath in the few minutes I have left.

I'm going to definitely need to cast a flight spell on myself, since it will be too difficult to engage the dragon otherwise. 

The thing I'm lacking the most here is information about my enemy. All I have to go on are legends and fairy tales, and I'm not sure how much I can rely on any of them in this situation. One thing that most legends agree on is that dragons have a high elemental resistance to fire and that they are immune to mind affecting spells and illusions. Other than that, I have no idea which spells would work best.

I already know that Kate's ice didn't really hurt the dragon, but maybe water would be a better choice? Water is after all the opposing element to fire. Actually, forget water, if I am to try elemental magic I may as well try them all, except fire of course.

Daren's sword seemed to at least be able to get through the dragon's tough scales but I do not know what enchantments he has on it. Maybe I could persuade him to give me his sword for the duration of this battle, and then I can fight Tyrath head on? The downside to this plan is that I don't seem to have a strength enhancing spell in my repertoire, so the power of my swing would depend entirely on my strength stat.


[395]I start off by casting protection from fire and a flight spell on myself.

I then fly out of the barrier, and right through the scorching flames. It feels as if I were in an oven, but at least I'm not getting any visible burns. The dragon sees me fly through his fire and lets out an intimidating roar.  I position myself at the same level of height as him, a few dozen feet from where he's hovering and I stop in mid-air.

The dragon sees me fly through his fire and lets out an intimidating roar.  I position myself at the same level of height as him, a few dozen feet from where he's hovering and I stop in mid-air.

Let's try acid first. I make a ball of acid and send it flying towards the dragon. Tyrath claps his wings together, which generates a strong gust of wind that scatters the acid, but my protection from wind spell prevents me from being blown away. 

For a moment, I could see the dragon appear in two places at the same time, as if he'd cloned himself, but then the clone disappears. Wait a minute. I know this effect! That's what happens when someone casts an illusion right in front of you. Was that gust of wind from before meant to disorient me so that I wouldn't see this?

I cast a spell on myself that allows me to see through illusions. Sure enough, the dragon in front of me disappears as soon as I cast the spell, and I see the real Tyrath closing in on me from the right.


[397]I start off by freezing time, and then I proceed to cast every single protection spell I know on myself, as well as a flight spell.

Next, I fly out of the barrier, and right through the scorching flames. It feels as if I were in an oven, but at least I'm not getting any visible burns.

The dragon is now casting an illusion of himself, and leaving it behind, while he tries to approach me from the right. It's a good thing I already cast a protection from illusions before starting this fight. He can't surprise me like this.

I mimic his earlier move and clap my hands, which creates an incredibly strong blast of air in front of me, sending the dragon back about fifty feet. 


[398]I start off by casting protection from fire and a flight spell on myself.

Next, I head directly for Daren and Kate. 

"Barry, what happened?" Daren asks me as I reach them. "This magic power radiating from you... It's insane!"

"I'm sorry, there's no time to explain. But I think I have enough power to beat the dragon on my own. Can I borrow your sword for a few minutes?"

"Beat the dragon on your own?... Barry, I don't..."

Daren pauses for a bit to think about what I've said.

"Fine, here's the sword. Just don't do anything too crazy."

I take his sword and prepare to fly out of the barrier to face the dragon. 

"Hey, Barry!" Daren calls out to me, as I turn back and see an unusually serious expression on his face. "Good luck..."

I nod to him, as I fly out of the barrier, and right through the scorching flames. It feels as if I were in an oven, but at least I'm not getting any visible burns. Tyrath sees me fly through his fire and lets out a powerful roar. I do not let him intimidate me and lunge at him fiercely with my sword in hand.

[401]I start off by casting protection from fire and a flight spell on myself.

Next, I cast the necessary protection spells on Rose, and head for Daren and Kate. 

"Barry, what happened?" Daren asks me as I reach them. "This magic power radiating from you... It's insane!"

"I'll explain later. I don't have much time, and I'll need to concentrate as much as possible on casting these protection spells."

After I finish casting the spells on the three of us, I fly out of the barrier to face the dragon. Finally, I can go all out now.

[404]

The power of my strike was not enough to break through his armored scales. The dragon immediately swings one of his claws at me, and I am forced to teleport away from him.

He then claps his wings together, which generates a strong gust of wind that sends me spinning backwards. That disoriented me a bit, so it took me a few seconds to locate the dragon again.

[410]

I notice that there's something off about the way the sun is shining on the dragon's scales. It's as if the light is coming from the wrong direction. Could it be that the dragon I'm looking at is an illusion? If that's the case, then where's the real dragon?

[412]



I suddenly see a vision of the dragon in front of me slowly fading away, and a different dragon appearing behind me. My premonition sense is trying to warn me of something. Could it be that I'm currently looking at an illusion?

[414]



I shoot a bolt of lightning at him, which hits him head on, although it doesn't seem to have affected him in any way. Suddenly, the dragon in front of me disappears and a different dragon appears behind me.

Tyrath quickly whips his tail towards me and grabs me with it. The force with which he's gripping me is suffocating. What is this? What just happened? Was that an illusion?

"You're not the only one who can cast magic, human," the dragon says.

The force of his tail's grip is so strong that I can feel it crushing my internal organs. As I cough up some blood, I can feel my vision starting to blur. The last thing I see is the dragon's hideous face, as he laughs triumphantly.

Tyrath whips his tail towards me and attempts to grab me with it. There was no time for me to dodge the hit, so I instinctively cast the time freezing spell that Eiden used earlier, stopping his tail a few inches before reaching me. My heart is beating like crazy. What is this? What just happened? Was that an illusion?

Damn it! I completely let my guard down. I won't be able to cast the time freezing spell again until the end of the battle, so I'd better make the most of this. 

I cast a spell that allows me to see through illusions, as well as a spell to protect me from wind, and another one to protect me from physical damage. This should be enough for now. 

I mimic the dragon's earlier move and clap my hands, which immediately cancels my time freezing spell and creates an incredibly strong blast of air in front of me, sending the dragon back about fifty feet.

I use my sword to slash at the dragon's tail, which immediately unfreezes time, and the dragon screams in pain as I draw blood with my blade. He then teleports back twenty feet and shouts to me.


[418]"I don't know how you were able to see through my illusion, human, but I'm not going to take it easy on you anymore."

After finishing his phrase, the dragon immediately appears in front of me and swings one of his claws at my chest. It was all I could do to teleport out of harm's way in time, with a short range spell suited for combat. 

Me and the dragon spend the next few seconds teleporting one after the other and trying to take each  other by surprise. This is getting me nowhere. I unleash a powerful explosion of fire all around me, which pushes the dragon back a few feet, but it doesn't harm him in the slightest. 

That's right. The legends always said that dragons are immune to flames, as well as mind affecting spells and illusions. Damn it, there's so many big spells I could cast right now, but almost all of them would endanger Kate, Daren, Rose and even myself. I'd have to get back to the others and cast some protection spells before I start shooting tornados out of my fingertips. If I do it now, I might still have time to finish this fight before my five minutes are up.

Damn it! If only I could cast my big spells now, I'd make short work of him. I think I can still make it if I go and cast the protection spells on the others right now.


[420]"I don't know how you were able to see through my illusion, human, but I'm not going to take it easy on you anymore."

The dragon then breathes fire hotter than ever before towards me. Instinctively, I hold the sword in front of me to defend from his attack. To my surprise, I see that the sword actually absorbs all of the dragon's flames into it, and it is now radiating magical power, looking as though it has been set ablaze.

Daren's sword could do something like this? What kind of crazy enchantments are on this thing anyway? Does this mean I can actually now use the dragon's flames as my own?

I slash my sword towards the dragon, which sends all of his flames back towards him, concentrated in one powerful beam.

It worked! I can't believe it! Let me try and see if it can also absorb other magical elements. I concentrate my magical power on the sword in the form of lightning. I can feel the sword charge up and as I finish my spell, I can actually see the electrical current surging through it.


[421]Casting protection spells on everyone would waste too much time. I'll just have to make better use of my offensive spells. 

I use my earth magic to break the rocky soil into pieces, and make the big chunks of rock fly all the way to my position. I then get all the rocks to spin around me at great speed, using them as a shield against the dragon. If he tries any more surprise teleports, he's going to get pummeled. 

I pull more chunks of rock out of the ground and send them all flying at Tyrath. He tries to teleport out of their way, but there's too many of them, and he gets hit by a few. He roars furiously. Finally, I did some damage to him. 

I take out even more rocks from the ground and make them all follow him, as he tries to fly out of their way. The rocks are only increasing in number, because he can't take them out with his claws faster than I can make them. 

After getting hit a few more times, Tyrath shoots out flames hotter than ever before, turning all of my rocks into molten lava. He then flies right through the lava and heads for me again. He breathes his fire towards me, and turns all of the rocks rotating around me into lava as well. This is no good. Lava isn't solid enough to inconvenience him, and he can simply shrug off the hotness of it given his resistance to fire.

[423]It's all or nothing. If we all die here, it's not like Daren will need this sword anymore anyway. Let's do this.

I cast my acid spell on the sword, and watch it slowly turn green, as steam starts coming out of it. The sword is now drenching in acid, but the corrosive agent is not eating away at the metal as one would normally expect. Instead, it seems to be empowering it. This sword is definitely an impressive piece of work. If Daren actually had any access to elemental magic, he'd be unstoppable.

This is it. This is the winning card I've been waiting for. The dragon doesn't stand a chance anymore.

I teleport right next to Tyrath and thrust my blade into his chest. The acid melts through his scales, and the sword passes through his tough skin like a hot knife through butter. The dragon starts screaming in pain, and he teleports away, shooting flames at me. I block them with my sword, but this replaces the acid effect it had before with a fire one. So that's how this thing works. 


[424]

I've already decided that I need Daren's sword to win this fight. The risk to lose the blade by casting acid on it is much too great to be worth it.

I'm going to have to make this quick. I teleport next to the dragon and thrust my blade into his chest.

The sword barely scratches his armored scales, and the dragon takes advantage of my failed attack to swing his right claw at me. I manage to block his strike with my sword, but he then almost immediately whips his tail at me, forcing me to teleport away from him.

I spend the next twenty seconds teleporting in and out of the dragon's range, trying to shatter his armored scales, but it's no use. I can't even get close to reaching his skin with my blade. 

Now Tyrath has gone on the offensive. He's teleporting faster and forcing me to spend my time dodging his attacks instead of looking for openings. I can barely even keep up with him anymore. What the hell am I doing? I am in control of more magical power than I ever dreamed would be possible, but I can't hold off a single dragon?! 


[425]

I've already decided that I need Daren's sword to win this fight. The risk to lose the blade by casting acid on it is much too great to be worth it.

I'm going to have to make this quick. I teleport next to the dragon and thrust my blade into his chest.

The sword shatters his armored scales and manages to break through his thick skin. The dragon holds back the pain, and swings his right claw at me. I quickly take the sword out of him and block his attack just in time, but he then almost immediately whips his tail at me, forcing me to teleport away from him.

This isn't going to be easy. The dragon and I spend the next minute teleporting one after the other, trying to take each other by surprise. Tyrath keeps breathing fire at me, but I use my sword to absorb his flames every time, and then I send them back at him. The dragon and I seem to be quite evenly matched, and I've drawn blood more than a few times, but I'm starting to wonder if I've got what it takes to finish him in the little time I have left.


[426]I'm just wasting time like this. There's no point in having all this power if I don't use it to its full extent.

I teleport next to Kate and Daren and conjure a strong barrier around them and Rose in order to stop the dragon from coming in. 

"Barry, what happened?" Daren asks me. "This magic power radiating from you... It's insane!"

"I'll explain later. I don't have much time, and I'll need to concentrate as much as possible on casting these protection spells."

After I finish casting the spells on the three of us, I do the same for Rose, and then I fly out of the barrier to face the dragon again. Finally, I can go all out now.


[427]I raise my hands in the air and feel all of my magical power flow through me. This is what I've always wanted. This is what I've been looking for all my life. I'm not going to let one single dragon stand in my way.

I start by creating a tornado. The wind around me is now so strong that it's literally breaking chunks of rock from the ground and making them fly around me, clashing with the trees that are getting uprooted one by one. It's almost like a scenario from a horror book. 

The dragon is struggling to keep himself airborne, while my protections from wind are allowing me to fly through the currents with ease. Next, I use my earth magic to animate a giant made out of rock. The ground trembles violently, as an enormous rock golem rises from it slowly, making it seem like it had been simply sleeping all of this time. Once it gets up, I can see that the giant measures at an impressive two hundred feet, and once it spots the dragon, it uses its huge hands to crush him between them.

Tyrath lets out a deafening roar. A roar so powerful that it creates an explosion of air all around him, and it actually shatters the giant's hands, setting the dragon free. That was so loud that I had to use a spell to avoid losing my consciousness. I can only hope that Daren and the others have access to sonic protection as well.

That was so loud it could have made me lose consciousness, were it not for my protections against sonic attacks. I can only hope that Daren and the others have access to sonic protection as well. 


[429]Now I'm the one starting to get angry. I can feel my body starting to radiate heat. I can even see steam coming out of me. Suddenly, I can feel my speed increase by the tenfold. What kind of spell did I just cast? My stat device never told me I had access to anything like this. I feel like I can never lose to anyone ever again.

Everything seems to be moving much slower all of a sudden. Or am I just the one moving faster? I can predict the dragon's attack before he even teleports in front of me, but I don't feel the need to dodge anymore. Instead, I simply block Tyrath's next claw strike with my left hand.

"No..." the dragon says, dumbfounded.

While I keep a grip on him with my left hand, I punch him in the chest with my right fist. The impact of my strike was so strong that I could feel some of his armored scales shatter from the force of my blow, as the dragon gets sent flying more than twenty feet backwards. Tyrath coughs up blood, and starts to speak, but I do not let him. I instantly teleport next to him and grab him by the tail. I then throw him into the ground, and when he collides with the earth he creates a huge crater and sends clouds of dust flying in all directions. 

One more hit should settle this. As I prepare to dash towards Tyrath to deliver the finishing blow, I can feel my powers starting to leave me.

[431]"I don't know what that means."

Eiden sighs. 

"Of course you don't," he says. "Take a look at your stat device. You'll understand when you see for yourself."

I take the stat device out of my pocket and look at its screen. What... What am I looking at here, exactly?

The numbers are all over the place. Every single one of my stats is far exceeding its maximum number, but they're dropping at a very fast rate. Now I understand what happened. I must have accidentally used all of the energy that Eiden pumped into my device in order to temporarily maximize all of the stats. That's why I suddenly got so powerful. That's why I didn't recognize the spell. 

"Do you understand now, Barry? The energy I gave you was never meant to be used like that. Magical energy doesn't grow on trees, you know? You should use it with more care."


[432]"I didn't activate anything."

Eiden sighs. 

"Yes, you did," he says. "You're just not aware of it. Take a look at your stat device. You'll understand when you see for yourself."

[433]"Why do you keep saving me?"

"I'm doing it because I see great potential in you, Barry. I have big plans for you!"

Big plans for me, huh? That sounds ominous...

"Of course, I'm starting to question my opinion of you when you do stupid things like this."

"I didn't do anything."

Eiden sighs.

"Of course you didn't," he says. "Just take a look at your stat device. You'll understand what I'm talking about when you see for yourself."

[434]Tyrath rushes towards Eiden, but he teleports behind the dragon, and shoots a beam of fire at him. Tyrath shrugs off the flames, and breathes his own fire at the stillwater again.  Just like last time, Eiden sends the flames back, but this time he also surrounds the dragon with four pillars of fire that explode in his face.

What is he doing? Doesn't he know that dragons are resistant to fire? Why does he keep attacking him like this?

"Do you mock me, stillwater?" Tyrath says. "If you don't start fighting seriously, you're going to be sorry."

Eiden says nothing, but keeps smiling at the dragon with his eyes closed. He is now flooding the whole sky with flames, and teleporting away every time the dragon tries to reach him. They're teleporting after each other so fast that I can barely tell what's happening anymore. The whole sky looks like it's on fire, as the two combatants' vague outlines are occasionally visible through the flames.

Suddenly, the whole area gets covered in a blue light, and I'm starting to feel an immense magical power coming from the air all around us.


[435]Suddenly, the whole area gets covered in a blue light, and I'm starting to feel an immense magical power coming from the air all around us.

"What's... What's happening?..." Tyrath says, trying to hold back the pain.

"Has it been so long you've forgotten, old friend?" I hear Eiden's voice coming from the left.

I turn around and see the stillwater floating in the air next to us, with his usual smile on his face.

"Eiden..." the dragon says.

"Just because these traps haven't been activated in more than a millennia does not mean they are out of function," Eiden continues. "The lessathi of old were anything but shoddy craftsmen. This trap was just a bit out of tune, that's all. Luckily, your continuous use of flames and Barry's volcanoes were just enough to warm it up!" 

As the two of them speak, the ground is shaking violently, and the blue light is intensifying.

This trap was just a bit out of tune, that's all. Luckily, your continuous use of flames was just enough to warm it up!" 


[438]"What just happened?"

"I'm sorry about your duel, Barry. I'm afraid you'll have to resume it some other time. Tyrath was caught in an old dragon trap that's been around for a few thousand years. The trap was supposed to get activated at the first sign of flames, but because it's been at least a thousand years since it was last used, its mechanism was a little rusty. That's why it needed some warming up before it could get triggered. That discharge of energy from the trap must have surely fried your stat device, but don't worry, it'll recover in a few minutes with all of your previous stats!"

"What did the trap do to the dragon?"

"It transported him to a dragon prison on this island. Since I doubt there's anyone actually guarding it at this point I imagine that he won't have much trouble escaping, but even so, he'll still have to destroy the prison's automatic defenses and he'll have to travel all the way back here. So it should be at least a few days before he comes back."


[439]"Who are the lessathi?"

"The lessathi are the most ancient race on this continent. Although the name is a bit hard to remember so most people prefer to call them simply "the ancients". Their talent at crafting magical artifacts and devices was unmatched a thousand years ago, and we still use many of those artifacts to this day. The trap that just got triggered was also made by them some two thousand years ago. It was supposed to get activated at the first sign of flames, but because it's been at least a thousand years since it was last used, its mechanism was a little rusty. That's why it needed to be warmed up a bit first. That discharge of energy from the trap must have surely fried your stat device, but don't worry, it'll recover in a few minutes with all of your previous stats!"

So it should be at least a few days before he comes back."


[440]"What did you do to him?"

"Me? I didn't do anything to him. He was just caught in an old dragon trap that's been around for a few thousand years. The trap was supposed to get activated at the first sign of flames, but because it's been at least a thousand years since it was last used, its mechanism was a little rusty. That's why I warmed it up with my fire spells."

"What happened to the dragon, then?"

"He was transported to a dragon prison on this island. Since I doubt there's anyone actually guarding it at this point I imagine that he won't have much trouble escaping, but even so, he'll still have to destroy the prison's automatic defenses and he'll have to travel all the way back here.

[442]"Eiden!" shouts Daren, as he comes closer to us. "What are YOU doing here?!"

"Wait... I don't understand... Isn't he your friend?" Rose asks us.

"That's what I thought, but it seems I was mistaken," Eiden says, feigning sadness.

He then turns to leave.

"No, wait, don't go!" Rose calls out to him. "I'm sure Daren didn't mean what he said!"

"I thank you for your kindness, Rose, but I can tell when I'm not wanted. I bid you farewell!"

He then starts fading away and teleports out of our sight. Or did he? After seeing how well he could mask his presence before, I'm starting to wonder. It's a bit creepy, knowing that he could just be standing there, invisible and untraceable, listening to everything we say. We really need to find some way to detect these kinds of things.

"Daren, how could you do this to your friend? That was horrible!" Rose says.


[443]"Yeah, Daren, you should be ashamed of yourself!"

"Damn it, Barry! You're not planning to make this any easier for me, are you?"

"He saved all of our lives!" Rose says. "I saw it happen before my eyes! We all would have been dead if not for him! He's the one that gave Barry all of those powers that allowed him to fight the dragon. Why are you acting like he's our enemy?"

"It's because he is our enemy," Kate tells her bluntly. "When we first met him this morning, he tried to kill Daren outright and ultimately decided against it, on a whim. If what you're saying is true, and he really did save all of our lives, then I am inclined to believe that this was also a decision he made on a whim. What was the motivation he gave for saving the four of us?"

Kate's rebuttal made Rose lose a bit of steam.


[444]"Calm down, Rose, it's not as simple as that."

"What's not that simple?" Rose says. "He saved all of our lives! I saw it happen before my eyes! We all would have been dead if not for him! He's the one that gave you all of those powers that allowed you to fight the dragon. Why are you acting like he's our enemy?"

What was the motivation he gave for saving the four of us?"

Kate's rebuttal made Rose lose a bit of steam.


[445]"Kate, could you freeze the whole area around us? I want to make sure that Eiden isn't hiding around us invisibly and listening to what we're saying."

Kate nods, and she sends a powerful wave of freezing magic all around us. The air has suddenly gotten a lot chillier, and all of the trees now look like they're made of crystal, but there's no sign of the stillwater. Even if he got to block Kate's attack, we would still have sensed at least some magical power coming from him if he were still here. I guess he really did just teleport away after all.

"I don't understand," Rose says. "What's gotten into everyone? Eiden saved all of our lives! I saw it happen before my eyes! We all would have been dead if not for him! He's the one that gave Barry all of those powers that allowed him to fight the dragon. Why are you acting like he's our enemy?"

Kate's rebuttal made Rose lose a bit of steam.


[446]"He didn't tell us. But judging by the name, I'd say it's a person that can use time altering magic," I tell her.

"Rose, did you start feeling any different after having withstood Eiden's spell?" Daren asks her. 

"No... I feel exactly the same as before. I think he was mistaken. I can't have time powers. His spell must have just malfunctioned, that's all."

"Hmm... Perhaps you're right," Daren says. "At any rate, we should be thankful enough that we somehow managed to make it out of this alive. I've heard stories about how dangerous this place was, but I never imagined it would be as bad as this. We're all in terrible shape. Here, let me start casting some healing spells."


[447]"According to Eiden, it's a person that isn't a mage, but has all sorts of time powers like stopping or rewinding time, and even seeing into the future," I tell her.

"Rose, did you start feeling any different after having withstood Eiden's spell?" Daren asks her. 

"No... I feel exactly the same as before. I think he was mistaken. I can't have time powers. His spell must have just malfunctioned, that's all."

Daren proceeds to heal us all in turn. When he starts healing Kate, I can clearly see that he's having some difficulty.

Daren proceeds to heal us all in turn. When he starts healing Kate, I can clearly see that he's having some difficulty.


[450]"Actually, it doesn't look that bad. More like a tattoo, than anything else."

Kate laughs at my comment.

"A tattoo, huh?" she says, studying her face in the mirror. "Yeah, I guess it does kind of look like one. Thank you, Barry. That made me feel a little better."


[451]"Damn, that's ugly. I'd be using a mask from now on if I were you."

"Careful, Barry," Kate says. "After that burn on half of my face, my eyesight may not be as good as it once was. No one could blame me if my aim were to fail me in battle, and if one of my ice cones were to end up disfiguring you by accident..."

The menacing look she has in her eyes is made all the more scary by the newly acquired scars on her face.

"Hey, now," Daren says. "Let's not forget we're all friends here. Come on, Rose. It's your turn to get healed."


[452]Once Daren finishes healing us all, we waste no more time and resume our journey, in order to avoid meeting any mages or creatures that may have been attracted by the loud noises of our previous battle.

"I still don't understand one thing, Barry," Kate tells me, as we walk side by side. "How did Eiden manage to give you all of those powers? As far as I know, transferring powers between mages is impossible without some kind of tool to assist them."

"Oh, he used my stat device. I'm not sure exactly what he did, but he made it start glowing, and then I suddenly got all of those spells. I've tried playing around with the stat booster ever since, in order to see if I could unlock some secret options or something, but I couldn't figure out how he did it."

"Wait, you're saying you got all of those powers through your stat device? No, that's impossible! In order for that to work, you'd need to have even less magical power than a human, otherwise it wouldn't match at all with the magical frequency of the device."

She pauses.

"Actually, come to think of it, your magical aura was always weaker than that of a normal human. Very weak, in fact. Almost as if you were a..."
