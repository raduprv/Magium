"So, Barry, let me get this straight," Daren says. "You're saying that trinket you're carrying with you is in fact a device that amplifies your physical attributes, which is powered by the magic all around us..."

"Right," I answer.

"And you're planning to use this device to fight the other mages that joined the tournament?"

"Correct."

Daren, Kate and I are sitting in a circle, on the rocky floor of a cave we found near the northern mountains. Our trip here has been rather uneventful, save for a few more dead bodies we've seen along the way. Daren has gotten out of his heavy armor since we arrived and is now wearing more comfortable clothes.


[75]

"So, Barry, let me get this straight," Daren says. "You're saying that trinket you're carrying with you is in fact a device that amplifies your physical attributes, which is powered by the magic all around us..."

"Right," I answer.

"And this device taught you an ancient language that made you able to communicate with the two deer?"

"Correct."

Daren, Kate and I are sitting in a circle, on the rocky floor of our deer host's cave. Our trip here has been rather uneventful, save for a few more dead bodies we've seen along the way. Daren has gotten out of his heavy armor since we arrived and is now wearing more comfortable clothes.

"Barry, there is no such thing as talking to animals. I've heard you 'talk' to them, and it's nothing but weird animal noises. Just because you got lucky and they actually brought us to their lair doesn't prove you right. Kate, could you knock some sense into our dear companion, here?"


[76]I show him my device's screen, where all of the nine stats are shown. Daren gives the device a long, pondering look, until he decides to speak.

"Alright. Here's my two copper pieces. I think that if we're to keep travelling in our current formation, and if that device of yours really does what you say it does, then what would help us all the most would be if you maxed that observation stat."

"Observation?... Why observation of all things?" I ask him.


[77]I show him my device's screen, where all of the nine stats are shown. Daren gives the device a long, pondering look, until he decides to speak.

"Observation?... Why observation of all things?" I ask him.


[78]"How did you get that plate?" I ask her. "Surely you didn't carry it all the way from the nearest city?"

"No, of course not! I conjured it the same way I conjured the food you see before you."

"You can... cast magic?"

As the two of us talk, I can hear Daren whisper to Kate.

"I swear, I'm never going to get used to hearing him talk like that!"

Elaria pays him no mind and answers my question.

"Yes, many animals on this continent can. It is a gift offered to us by our protector, the great golden fox. Molan's father used to be a lot better at it than I am, but I try my best."


[79]"Wait, so the two of you are cannibals?" I ask her.

The deer laughs.

"No, we're not! But I can see why you'd think that. Perhaps my choice of deer meat was a bit uninspired. Our protector, the great golden fox has taught me the art of  food conjuration, and I thought you might prefer some meat rather than vegetables. I've also taken the liberty of conjuring a plate, since I know humans are not used to eating off the ground."

"You can... cast magic?"

As the two of us talk, I can hear Daren whisper to Kate.

"I swear, I'm never going to get used to hearing him talk like that!"

Elaria pays him no mind and answers my question.

"Yes, many animals on this continent can. It is a gift offered to us by our protector. Molan's father used to be a lot better at it than I am, but I try my best."


[80]A grim thought occurs to me. I look at the deer meat in front of me and realize I haven't seen Molan in a while. No... She wouldn't... Would she?

"Molan?" I call out, jumping to my feet and looking all around me. "Molan!"

"Yeah?" Molan answers from one of the darker corners of the cave.

I slowly start to calm down as I hear the fawn's voice. Gods, what was I thinking? I'm really letting this afternoon's events get to my head. Elaria was surprised by my outburst, but it only took her a few seconds to understand what happened.

"By the great fox, you didn't think I would... Molan is my only son, I would never...

"I'm sorry. I'm letting this tournament get to me... I didn't mean to offend you."

"There's no need to apologize, outlander. Assuming the worst is only natural, given our current situation. Perhaps my choice of deer meat was uninspired, but I assure you I did not kill any of my kind to make this. Our protector, the great golden fox has taught me the art of  food conjuration. I've also taken the liberty of conjuring a plate, since I know humans are not used to eating off the ground."

"You can... cast magic?

"Yes, many animals on this continent can. It is a gift offered to us by our protector. Molan's father used to be a lot better at it than I am, but I try my best."


[81]"Who is this golden fox you speak of? Your leader?"

"You could say that. She is a very old spirit that has guided all animals on the continent for thousands of years. She is our protector, our shepherd and our teacher, and we all aspire to be like her."  

Oblivious to the meaning of our conversation, Daren decided to stop waiting for me, and started to eat. He offers Kate a morsel of deer meat.

"Barry is busy talking to his animal friends. He'll join us when he's done. Eat up, or your food will get cold."

"Shush, I'm trying to listen," Kate replies.

"You're kidding. You mean to tell me you actually understand what they're saying?

"Only a little. Which is why I need some silence in order to concentrate. So be quiet."

Kate's words seem to have caught Elaria's attention.

"There is no need to be embarrassed about your poor grasp of our language, woman outlander," the deer tells her in the ancient language. "I believe your name is Kate, is it not? Feel free to join our conversation if you want. I will try to use only words that are more commonly known in order to ease your understanding."


[82]"What happened to Molan's father?"

"He was killed a few years ago by some humans, while he was defending us. He managed to hold them off long enough for us to escape, but he didn't make it."

"Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--"

"It's no problem. You couldn't have known."

Oblivious to the meaning of our conversation, Daren decided to stop waiting for me, and started to eat. He offers Kate a morsel of deer meat.

"Barry is busy talking to his animal friends. He'll join us when he's done. Eat up, or your food will get cold."

"Shush, I'm trying to listen," Kate replies.

"You're kidding. You mean to tell me you actually understand what they're saying?

Kate's words seem to have caught Elaria's attention.

"There is no need to be embarrassed about your poor grasp of our language, woman outlander," the deer tells her in the ancient language. "I believe your name is Kate, is it not? Feel free to join our conversation if you want. I will try to use only words that are more commonly known in order to ease your understanding."

Kate was caught off guard by Elaria's proposal. She's struggling to form a coherent sentence in the deer's language.


[83]She pauses.

"But I digress. My friends, I thank you once more for your help. Our home is your home until you decide to take your leave. Please, eat to your heart's content, and do not hesitate to ask for more! I will be over there if you need me."

With these last words, Elaria bows her head, and goes to sit near her offspring, who is sleeping in a dark corner of the cave.

Daren, who has been eating all this time, is now looking at us, and shaking his head.

"Ok," he says. "I only have one question for you. Did you ask her if she's got more of these?"

He points at the plate of food in front of him.

"She said we can ask for a refill whenever we want," I answer him.

"Perfect! Then there's no need to hold back."

After the three of us are done feasting, Daren decides to pick up our initial conversation where we left off.

"Alright," he says. "Barry. I'm going to need you to decide now, and tell us how you're planning to use that stat booster of yours in the immediate future, so that we can prepare our tactics accordingly. We can't afford to go into our next fight without a plan."


[84]After taking some time to consider my options, I give Daren my answer.

"I'm planning to focus primarily on avoiding attacks and drawing opponents' attention from now on."

"So I'm guessing that means you'll be maxing your speed and reflexes, then. And maybe premonition and combat technique for added versatility. Just make sure you don't put yourself at risk too much. Let me and Kate do the actual fighting. You just distract their attention."

Daren shifts his gaze towards Kate.

"Now, for the two of us. As you said after our last battle, I would rather not fight against weapon enchanters unless I have no choice. That's why I'm going to ask you to take care of them when the time comes."

Kate nods at Daren, as he continues to talk.

"As for myself, I am particularly good against elementalists, summoners and shapeshifters so I'll focus on them if we meet any."

He is speaking about mage specializations. Most mages will pick a certain type of magic and dedicate their life to perfecting it, instead of trying to learn as many spells as possible. 

Weapon enchanters use their magic to make their gear as strong as possible. Since they mostly rely on their weapons for combat, they will likely also train themselves in at least one martial art.


[85]After taking some time to consider my options, I give Daren my answer.

"I'm planning to fight alongside you two, as crazy as it may sound. Otherwise, I'd just be dragging you down."

Daren sighs.

"I had a feeling you might say something like that. So I'm guessing that means you'll be maxing your strength, toughness and combat technique then. And maybe premonition, since it's probably good against surprise attacks. Just make sure you don't overestimate yourself. Let me and Kate handle our strong opponents. You just try and keep the weaklings out of our way."

Daren shifts his gaze towards Kate.

"Now, for the two of us. As you said after our last battle, I would rather not fight against weapon enchanters unless I have no choice. That's why I'm going to ask you to take care of them when the time comes."

Kate nods at Daren, as he continues to talk.

[86]After taking some time to consider my options, I give Daren my answer.

"I want to focus on helping the two of you by observing the battlefield and providing tactical information."

"A wise decision. So I'm guessing your main two attributes will be hearing and observation then. But that's not enough. If the enemy sees you just standing there they'll focus you first, like they did this time.  You'll need to have at least one defensive stat prepared, like toughness, reflexes or premonition to be safe. Kate and I won't be able to defend you all the time."

Daren shifts his gaze towards Kate.

"Now, for the two of us. As you said after our last battle, I would rather not fight against weapon enchanters unless I have no choice. That's why I'm going to ask you to take care of them when the time comes."

[87]

As we stand guard,  Daren starts telling me stories about his travels around the world, and the adventures he's had. He tells me of the fifty foot giants that live in the far east of the Northern Continent. He tells me how he's cured the dreaded Iknar plague of the Eastern Continent by himself, and how he defeated the green wyvern of the north. 

Listening to him tell me all these stories made me realize why I defended him instinctively from Cutthroat Dave yesterday. Even though I never really thought about it before, I guess I always kind of admired him. He's like all of those heroes from the fairy tales I used to read when I was a kid, and he's a living example of what I've always aspired to become.

"I've been in a lot of places over the years, Barry. But everywhere I go, it's always the same. The weak are oppressed by the strong, the few are killed by the many. Everywhere I go, there's people dying from starvation, plague, war, or some monster invasion. I've seen death all my life, but I never get used to it. Seeing all of those dead bodies just lying there, lifeless, yesterday... It made me feel an intense pain in my chest. It was as though I could feel the suffering of each of them, and the fear that went through their hearts as they took their last breath. What about you, Barry? What did you feel when you saw all those dead people?"


[88]



I notice that the stars are not only unusually bright tonight, but there also seems to be a certain symmetry between them, almost as if they were forming symbols in the sky. 

I must be imagining things. The symbols don't look like they are written in any language I've ever heard of. It must be a coincidence.

[89]



I notice that the stars are not only unusually bright tonight, but there also seems to be a certain symmetry between them, almost as if they were forming symbols in the sky. 

I suddenly realize that the symbols are from an ancient language that my stat device has taught me. If I read all of the signs together, then the sentence could roughly be translated as: "The dragon knows where to find the source of all magic."

Does that mean that there's a dragon on this continent? And he knows the location of the Magium? I've heard about spells that brighten the stars in order to transmit information, but only in fairy tales. And the same goes for dragons. It must be a coincidence. I try to forget what I saw and focus on guarding the cave.


[90]"I didn't really have time to feel anything. I guess I was too preoccupied with staying alive."

"I almost forgot. That was your first real battle, wasn't it? You handled it well, Barry. You should be proud!"

Daren pauses for a few seconds to gaze into the distance before he continues.

"You know, when I heard about this tournament, my first thought was that finally, after a lifetime of good deeds, after a lifetime of trying to make a difference, someone was sending me a sign. I've tried all of my life to save the world from its misery, but no matter how hard I tried, my efforts were never enough. But with the help of the Magium... Maybe, just maybe I might have a chance."

Daren looks at me, and notices I'm a little worried.


[91]"I felt sorry for them. But I guess I came here prepared for the worst. I knew I'd be seeing a lot of death along my way. So I've decided to not let it affect me."

"Then you are stronger than I am, Barry."

Daren pauses for a few seconds to gaze into the distance before he continues.

"You know, when I heard about this tournament, my first thought was that finally, after a lifetime of good deeds, after a lifetime of trying to make a difference, someone was sending me a sign. I've tried all of my life to save the world from its misery, but no matter how hard I tried, my efforts were never enough. But with the help of the Magium... Maybe, just maybe I might have a chance."

Daren looks at me, and notices I'm a little worried.


[92]"I was almost about to puke. It was my first time seeing so many dead bodies in one place."

"That feeling will go away with time. I fear that you'll be seeing so many bodies in the following days that you'll start getting used to their appearance and smell very soon."

Daren pauses for a few seconds to gaze into the distance before he continues.

"You know, when I heard about this tournament, my first thought was that finally, after a lifetime of good deeds, after a lifetime of trying to make a difference, someone was sending me a sign.

Maybe, just maybe I might have a chance."

Daren looks at me, and notices I'm a little worried.


[93]"I see no reason why the Magium can't be shared, Barry. Even if I win this tournament, I promise that I will use the power of the Magium to help you achieve your dream. I hope you will do the same for me if you win."

His straightforwardness and his honesty took me by surprise.

"Of course I will," I tell him. "Since we both already know which one of us will be winning this tournament!"

"Hah! That's the spirit!"

After yet another pause, Daren decides to change the subject.

"So, how's it going with Kate, then? Are you making any progress with her?"


[94]"Don't worry, Barry! I promise I'll help you get out of here. Even if it puts me at a disadvantage in the tournament. I won't rest until I've repaid you for saving my life."

"I, uh... Thanks."

I had forgotten about his plan to help me get off the continent. I'll have to think of an excuse to remain here before reaching one of the cities.

After yet another pause, Daren decides to change the subject.

"So, how's it going with Kate, then? Are you making any progress with her?"


[95]"Don't worry, Barry! I promise I'll help you find the cure for your sister. Even if it puts me at a disadvantage in the tournament. I won't rest until I've repaid you for saving my life."

"I, uh... Thanks."

I had almost forgotten about the sick sister story I told him when he figured out I was human. I'll have to take care to not give myself away in the near future.

After yet another pause, Daren decides to change the subject.

"So, how's it going with Kate, then? Are you making any progress with her?"


[96]"I'm not trying to seduce her, Daren."

"Of course you're not!" Daren says, in a sarcastic manner.

Slowly, Daren's smile fades away from his face and he adopts a more serious tone.

"Listen," he says. "I know your heart is in the right place. But you know as well as I do that women simply can't be born as mages. It's not in their blood. I don't know why she appears different from a normal banshee to you, and I don't know why the banshee inside her hasn't awakened yet, but it's only a matter of time. One day she will turn into a banshee, and I want you to be prepared when the time comes."

Daren takes a small device of his own out of his front pocket and hands it to me. It appears to be a magical transceiver. These devices are mostly used by soldiers, when they need to transmit information to each other over short distances, without having to shout to one another.

"I want you to carry this with you at all times. If you're ever in danger, just tap this three times, and I'll come over to help as fast as I can."


[97]"She still hasn't given in to my charms."

Daren laughs.

"No worries, take your time. We have all the time in the world!"

Slowly, Daren's smile fades away from his face and he adopts a more serious tone.

"Listen," he says. "I know your heart is in the right place. But you know as well as I do that women simply can't be born as mages. It's not in their blood. I don't know why she appears different from a normal banshee to you, and I don't know why the banshee inside her hasn't awakened yet, but it's only a matter of time.

[98]"She's eating out of the palm of my hand!"

Daren laughs.

"Good on you, Barry! Keep up the good work!"

Slowly, Daren's smile fades away from his face and he adopts a more serious tone.

"Listen," he says. "I know your heart is in the right place. But you know as well as I do that women simply can't be born as mages. It's not in their blood. I don't know why she appears different from a normal banshee to you, and I don't know why the banshee inside her hasn't awakened yet, but it's only a matter of time.

[99]I put the device back, and enter the cave. We wake up Kate and she goes outside to guard the entrance, as me and Daren go to sleep.

I wake up to Kate's voice several hours later. She is whispering and making sure that Daren can't hear us.

"Wake up, stillwater," she says. "I need your help with something."

"Wait, you need MY help?"

"Be quiet, you'll wake Daren. Yes, I need you to come with me and take a look at something. It won't take you more than a minute."

"And why would I help you? All you've done is give me a hard time ever since we've met."

"Because then I'd owe a debt to you. And I always pay my debts."


[100]I put the device back, and enter the cave. We wake up Kate and she goes outside to guard the entrance, as me and Daren go to sleep.

I wake up to Kate's voice several hours later. She is whispering and making sure that Daren can't hear us.

"Wake up, stillwater," she says. "It's time for you to pay your debt."

It takes me a few moments to realize she's referring to the discussion we had yesterday about her saving my life.

"I thought I already said I don't owe you anything."

"You did. But think of it this way. If you ignore your debt to me now, I am never going to help you again. Are you really willing to take that risk for the rest of the tournament? All I'm asking of you is to come with me and take a look at something. It won't take you more than a minute. Do that, and you can consider your debt paid."


[101]I put the device back, and enter the cave. We wake up Kate and she goes outside to guard the entrance, as me and Daren go to sleep.

I wake up to Kate's voice several hours later. She is whispering and making sure that Daren can't hear us.

"Wake up, stillwater," she says. "It's time for you to pay your debt."

It takes me a few moments to realize she's referring to the discussion we had yesterday about her saving my life.

"And just how exactly do you want me to pay this debt?"

"All you have to do is come with me and take a look at something. It won't take you more than a minute. Do that, and you can consider your debt paid."


[102]"So how did you come to know the true function of the stat devices?" I ask Kate.

She gives me a pondering look, probably trying to decide how much of the truth she's willing to disclose to me. 

"The stat boosters were created on this continent. I was born here as well. It is more common for people on this continent to know what these devices do than it is for people in the rest of the world."

"Wait, you were born here? Didn't you come here as a participant in this tournament?"

"I was born here, but I didn't spend my whole life here. It is not so easy to return here once you've left, however. I used this tournament as a means to come back, because I have some unfinished business to attend to."

"And I'm guessing this unfinished business of yours is somehow related to this thing you want me to look at."

She doesn't make any comment, but her silence is enough to confirm my hypothesis. Kate decides to completely change the subject, instead.

She stops in front of me, and looks me straight in the eye.


[103]"So where did you learn the language the deer were speaking?"

"I was born on this continent. Unlike the rest of the world, it is not so uncommon to know ancient languages here, because there are still some people who speak it."

"Wait, you were born here? Didn't you come here as a participant in this tournament?"

"I was born here, but I didn't spend my whole life here. It is not so easy to return here once you've left, however. I used this tournament as a means to come back, because I have some unfinished business to attend to."

"And I'm guessing this unfinished business of yours is somehow related to this thing you want me to look at."

She doesn't make any comment, but her silence is enough to confirm my hypothesis. Kate decides to completely change the subject, instead.

She stops in front of me, and looks me straight in the eye.


[104]"So what did you want to ask me in private?"

She stops in front of me, and looks me straight in the eye.


[105]"There's something that's been bugging me ever since we met yesterday," she says. 

"When you and Daren first saw me, you started whispering between yourselves for about a minute. You said you were talking about my looks and I was willing to take your word for it at first, but then a whole day had passed and none of you made a single comment about me being a banshee. Even after that bearded fool of a mage spelled it out for you when we were battling. It's painfully obvious to me now that you were discussing whether I was a banshee or not, and decided there was no need to purify me."

She pauses a bit, before she continues.

"The question is why? I decided to seek Daren's help because I fooled myself into thinking someone as kind hearted as him would not sentence me to death. But now that I have cleared my head and thought about it, I realize how much I've put myself at risk by showing myself to him.  Why did Daren decide I wasn't a banshee when all the evidence pointed to the contrary?"

Kate still doesn't trust me. If I tell her I'm the one that convinced Daren to spare her life, she's either not going to believe me, or she'll get suspicious of my motives and completely lose her trust in Daren. Maybe she'll believe me if I tell her Daren was the one that decided not to purify her?


[106]"There's something that's been bugging me ever since we met yesterday," she says. 

"When you and Daren first saw me, you started whispering between yourselves for about a minute. You made that insipid joke about making a pass at me which threw me off course for a bit, but then a whole day had passed and none of you made a single comment about me being a banshee. Even after that bearded fool of a mage spelled it out for you when we were battling. It's painfully obvious to me now that you were discussing whether I was a banshee or not, and decided there was no need to purify me."

[107]"There's something that's been bugging me ever since we met yesterday," she says. 

"When you and Daren first saw me, you started whispering between yourselves for about a minute. When I questioned you about it, you told me an obvious lie. I was almost about to let it slide, but then a whole day had passed and none of you made a single comment about me being a banshee. Even after that bearded fool of a mage spelled it out for you when we were battling. It's painfully obvious to me now that you were discussing whether I was a banshee or not, and decided there was no need to purify me."

Maybe she'll believe me if I tell her Daren was the one that decided not to purify her?


[108]"There's something that's been bugging me ever since we met yesterday," she says. 

"When you and Daren first saw me, you started whispering between yourselves for about a minute. You said you were trying to decide whether I was a banshee or not, and Daren said  you had already established I wasn't one."

She pauses a bit, before she continues.

"The question is why? I decided to seek Daren's help because I fooled myself into thinking someone as kind hearted as him would not sentence me to death. But now that I have cleared my head and thought about it, I realize how much I've put myself at risk by showing myself to him.  Why did Daren decide I wasn't a banshee when all the evidence pointed to the contrary?"

Kate still doesn't trust me. If I tell her I'm the one that convinced Daren to spare her life, she's either not going to believe me, or she'll get suspicious of my motives and completely lose her trust in Daren. Maybe she'll believe me if I tell her Daren was the one that decided not to purify her?


[109]"Well, in that case, I also have a question for you. You may not be a banshee but you can't be a mage either. Women can't be born as mages. So what are you?"

"Who says I was born a mage?"

My mind goes blank for a second, while I try to make sure I understood what she said correctly.

"Hold on, do you mean to tell me that you were born as a normal human, and that you later became a mage?"

"That is exactly what I'm saying."

"How?! Did you get access to the Magium? How did you do it? I must know!"

I realize too late that I had let the excitement get the better of me. Kate is looking at me with an expression that shows both bewilderment and a sudden understanding.

"By the gods," she says. "You were telling the truth, weren't you? You really are a human, and you came here in the hopes of becoming a mage. Listen to me, I have no idea what could motivate you enough to go on this suicidal quest, but the only things that you'll find at the end of your journey will be agony and despair. Quit now, and you might still make it out of this alive."


[110]"Why not?"

"See for yourself. Go on, try and head back to our cave."

Hesitantly, I start retracing my steps back towards the cave. Once I start walking, however, I get a powerful urge to go the other way.  I try again and I get the same result. No matter how many times I try, I simply can't keep going in the same direction. I keep turning in the opposite direction, sometimes, without even noticing. Is this some sort of spell? In all of my research, I've never read of such a thing.

"What did you do?" I ask Kate.

"I see. Apparently not even someone as learned as you would be familiar with this spell. It is understandable. They don't really use suggestion magic outside the continent of Varathia after all. The spell I used is part of a subset of magic called suggestion. What these spells do is that they insert an idea inside your head, and they make you think you were the one that came up with it. You may have noticed that something was wrong because you were specifically aiming to go in that direction, but most mages wandering around this area won't even notice the spell's effect."

"But how do I get around it?"


[111]"Oh? Are you suggesting he can defend himself while asleep?"

Kate frowns at me.

"If you are so worried about your dear friend Daren, then by all means, go back and check on him. I'll wait for you here."

Hesitantly, I start retracing my steps back towards the cave. Once I start walking, however, I get a powerful urge to go the other way.  I try again and I get the same result. No matter how many times I try, I simply can't keep going in the same direction. I keep turning in the opposite direction, sometimes, without even noticing. Is this some sort of spell? In all of my research, I've never read of such a thing.

"What did you do?" I ask Kate.

"See, if you would have asked me nicely from the beginning instead of being a smartass, I would have answered your question. I guess you'll just have to live without knowing. But as you can clearly see, you don't need to worry about anyone getting near our cave until we come back. Let's go, our destination lies not much farther."

After about five more minutes of walking, we finally come to a halt. The area we stopped in is full of fallen trees, similar to the one where we fought yesterday. Except this time there are no bodies. However, there's clearly been a big battle here. Perhaps even the battle that charged up my stat device before going to sleep. I can still feel the traces of leftover magic resonating strongly in the air around me.


[112]"Damn you! I'm not leaving my friend behind!"

"What?... When did I ever suggest such a thing? If you are so worried about your dear friend Daren, then by all means, go back and check on him. I'll wait for you here."

Hesitantly, I start retracing my steps back towards the cave. Once I start walking, however, I get a powerful urge to go the other way.  I try again and I get the same result.

In all of my research, I've never read of such a thing.

"What did you do?" I ask Kate.

"See, if you would have asked me nicely from the beginning instead of throwing groundless accusations, I would have answered your question. I guess you'll just have to live without knowing. But as you can clearly see, you don't need to worry about anyone getting near our cave until we come back. Let's go, our destination lies not much farther."

[113]



Suddenly I see a vision of a dart being shot towards Kate. I realize immediately that what I've just seen was a premonition. But where did the dart come from? 

I turn back, and start looking carefully towards the trees far in the distance.

As I look towards the forest, I spot two shadowy figures hiding behind one of the trees.  One of them seems to be holding a crossbow, and it's aimed right at Kate.

"What happened?" asks Kate. "What are you looking for?"

The man behind the tree shoots his crossbow but I was waiting for it. 

"Look out!" I say, as I push Kate out of the dart's way.

"You blundering buffoon!" I can hear a man shout from behind the trees. His voice is high pitched, and could be easily mistaken for that of a woman, if you weren't paying attention. 

"How did you manage to miss that shot? Plan B! Go for plan B! Now!"

Suddenly, all of the trees around us get covered in a cloud of smoke. Between the lack of light, the distance, and the smoke screen, it is now almost impossible to tell where our enemies are hiding, except for the vague sense of their magic auras.


[114]



Suddenly I see a vision of a dart being shot towards Kate. I realize immediately that what I've just seen was a premonition. But where did the dart come from? 

I turn back, and start looking carefully towards the trees far in the distance.

Whoever shot that dart must be hiding behind the trees, but it's too dark to see them clearly. 

"What happened?" asks Kate. "What are you looking for?"

Before I get the chance to react,  a dart hits Kate in her left shoulder, and she drops to one knee.

"I'm alright..." Kate says, although she's clearly lying. She is breathing heavily and seems to be struggling to keep her consciousness.

I can hear a man laugh from behind the trees. His voice is high pitched, and could be easily mistaken for that of a woman, if you weren't paying attention. 

"As expected of a banshee," the man shouts. "Even an expensive sleep dart such as this is not enough to bring you down. But you are barely standing. The outcome of this battle is clear. Surrender now, and we'll show you mercy. We'll grant you and your human companion a quick and painless death."


[115]





As we speak, I suddenly hear a voice far behind me. 

"What are you waiting for? Shoot her!"

I turn back immediately, trying to identify the source of the sound.

As I look towards the forest, I spot two shadowy figures hiding behind one of the trees.  One of them seems to be holding a crossbow, and it's aimed right at Kate.

"What happened?" asks Kate. "What are you looking for?"

The man behind the tree shoots his crossbow but I was waiting for it.

[117]



"I just meant to say that you're usually a lot more--"

Before I get to finish my sentence, a dart comes out of nowhere and hits Kate in her left shoulder, making her drop to one knee.

"I'm alright..." Kate says, although she's clearly lying. She is breathing heavily and seems to be struggling to keep her consciousness.

I can hear a man laugh from behind the trees. His voice is high pitched, and could be easily mistaken for that of a woman, if you weren't paying attention.

[118]I hesitate, but I decide to go with Kate's plan. Trying to fight a hundred armed men by myself would be suicidal.

"Don't do anything stupid," I tell Kate as I head out of her ice dome. "Just try to stay alive until I get back."

As I reach the trees, Kate shouts after me.

"Wait! I forgot to tell you--"

The loud horn drowns out the sound of her voice, as she is forced to close back her dome to defend from all of the incoming crossbow bolts. I'm not sure if she realized I didn't hear all of that, but there's no more time to stand here and wait.

I manage to quickly run past two of the armed men, while they are focused on Kate. I keep running without looking back, straight towards our cave. 

Once I get closer, though, I start feeling a powerful urge to turn the other way. Of course. Kate's barrier. I had completely forgotten about it in my rush to get out of that battlefield. Was this what Kate was trying to warn me about?

I desperately try to keep going the right way, but without even realizing it, I always end up turning back. After running back and forth a few times, I suddenly feel a sharp pain in my chest. I realize I've been shot. One of the men that attacked us must have managed to catch up with me while I was wasting my time here, running around in circles. Before I even get the chance to turn around, I get shot two more times, and I fall to the ground, while my consciousness slowly fades away. 


[119]I hesitate, but I decide to go with Kate's plan. Trying to fight a hundred armed men by myself would be suicidal.

"Don't do anything stupid," I tell Kate as I head out of her ice dome. "Just try to stay alive until I get back."

I manage to quickly run past two of the armed men, while they are focused on Kate. I keep running without looking back, straight towards our cave. 

As I reach Kate's barrier, I start focusing on the cave, specifically, and after doing that, just as Kate said, my mind clears and I am able to continue on my way. When I finally reach our camp, I wake up Daren by shaking him violently.

"Daren! Wake up! Kate's in trouble. You have to help. Quick!"

"What?... What time is it?"

"There's no time! You have to come with me. Please!"

Daren quickly puts on his armor and follows me out of the cave.


[120]They say there is a very fine line between bravery and stupidity. As I stand here, in the middle of this forest, gazing at all of the explosions far in the distance, I realize I may well have crossed that line, to a point of no return.

My name is Barry. I am twenty-eight years old, and  I could quite accurately be described as your everyday ordinary guy. I have no talents, no particular skills and no academic background. The only thing that defines me is my lifelong obsession to become a mage. It is what I've wished for ever since I was five years old. It has been my driving passion throughout my life, as I've constantly amassed knowledge about mages and travelled the world in the hopes of finding a way to make my dream come true.

After endless years of searching through dusty tomes and weathered parchments I have finally found a way to do it.

The catch? I need to first win a tournament against the most powerful mages in the world. Sounds crazy? That's probably because it is. But it is far too late to go back now. The only way that's left for me is forward.

As I stand here, knowing that it's no longer possible to return to my normal life, I can't help but feel quite ...


[121]"She wanted to ask me in private why we didn't try to purify her. She was afraid that if she'd ask you, personally, she might give you ideas."

"So she knows that she's bound to become a banshee. Doesn't she understand that the purification ritual is almost guaranteed to succeed?"


[122]"We thought we could handle it by ourselves. It wasn't that far away and she needed my help to study some magical traces."

"Well you thought wrong. We'd better get out of here, before we find out some of these people actually lived long enough to call for reinforcements."

Daren lifts Kate off the ground and starts carrying her in his arms. We manage to get back to our cave safely, and he lays Kate on the floor letting her have some well-deserved rest.


[123]"Kate needed my help to study some magical traces, and this place wasn't that far away. She cast a barrier that prevents enemies from approaching our cave, so you'd be safe while we were gone."

"I'm not talking about my safety, Barry. I'm talking about yours! This is exactly why we should always stick together. Look at what happens the moment we split up. Come on, we'd better get out of here, before we find out some of these people actually lived long enough to call for reinforcements."

Daren lifts Kate off the ground and starts carrying her in his arms. We manage to get back to our cave safely, and he lays Kate on the floor letting her have some well-deserved rest.


[124]"She never said that she's a banshee. Just that the evidence pointed that way."

"You won't be able to ignore the truth forever, Barry. I only pray that when you finally come to your senses, it won't be too late.  Now come on, we'd better get out of here, before we find out some of these people actually lived long enough to call for reinforcements."

Daren lifts Kate off the ground and starts carrying her in his arms. We manage to get back to our cave safely, and he lays Kate on the floor letting her have some well-deserved rest.


[125]"Actually she was born human, but became a mage afterwards."

"She told you this? And you believe her? You won't be able to ignore the truth forever, Barry. I only pray that when you finally come to your senses, it won't be too late. Now come on, we'd better get out of here, before we find out some of these people actually lived long enough to call for reinforcements."

Daren lifts Kate off the ground and starts carrying her in his arms. We manage to get back to our cave safely, and he lays Kate on the floor letting her have some well-deserved rest.


[126]I agree to go with her plan, and she dismisses her dome.

"There's one over there, right beneath that branch," I tell her.  

She sends a cone of ice his way and hits him in the chest. 

"You got him! There's another one over there, right next to that tree."

"Which tree?"

"That one."

"Which side?"

"The left one."

"What's his height?"

"Height?..."

I measure him up with my eyes.

"About... five foot seven, I guess?"


[127]After I pick up the crossbow, I see that an enormous hand made of ice is now holding their leader by the back of his tunic and dragging him towards us, while he's frantically struggling to break free. By the looks of his fancy garments, he appears to be some rich noble from one of the more prosperous cities of the west. That would explain how he could motivate so many people to follow him on this suicide mission.

"Let me go! I order you! In the name of the duke of Bagelberry! Unhand me!"

The ice hand ignores him completely, and throws him at our feet. As he sees us, the man lets out a loud squeak, and jumps back. He trips over his own feet and lands on his rear.  

"Please... Please!" his tone of voice has completely changed, and he sounds like he's about to cry.

He throws himself at my feet.

"I only wanted to become famous by winning the tournament! I'm sorry I attacked you! Please, don't kill me! I have a lot of money! Here, you can take it. You can take it all! Just spare me my life. Please!"

He throws a bag of golden coins on the ground as he throws himself at my feet. This is quite a lot of money. I could easily live most of my remaining life in luxury with just this amount.


[128]With the way he's acting, I doubt he'll ever muster up the courage to attack us again. 

"Very well. I'll take your money in exchange for your life. Now get out of my sight. I never want to see you again."

"Y-Y-You'll never see me again! I promise!"

He scrambles to his feet and starts to run away.

Before he even takes his first step, however, a spike made of ice pops out of the ground, and impales him through his chest.

"Why?.. Why did--" he attempts to say, before his head drops to the side and his expression goes blank.

"Kate, what did you do?! I was trying to spare his life!"

"And you did. Congratulations! Thanks to you, his lifespan was extended by three whole seconds. You should be proud!"


[129]With the way he's acting, I doubt he'll ever muster up the courage to attack us again. 

"I don't need your money," I tell him. "Just get out of my sight. I never want to see you again."

"Y-Y-You'll never see me again! I promise!"

He grabs his bag of money from the ground and starts to run away.

Before he even takes his first step, however, a spike made of ice pops out of the ground, and impales him through his chest.

"Why?.. Why did--" he attempts to say, before his head drops to the side and his expression goes blank.

"Kate, what did you do?! I was trying to spare his life!"

"And you did. Congratulations! Thanks to you, his lifespan was extended by three whole seconds. You should be proud!"


[130]I ignore his plead and shoot him in the head. He would have done the same to me in this situation. I take his money and I say to Kate:

"We're done here. Let's get back to our cave."


[131]I ignore his plead and shoot him in the head. He would have done the same to me in this situation. I decide to not take his money, since it's unlikely it will be of any use to me in this tournament and it will just weigh me down. I then say to Kate:

"We're done here. Let's get back to our cave."


[132]"You're telling me I can have all your money," I tell him. "But that's not all of your money is it? Where are you hiding the rest of it?"

"W-What do you mean? That's all I have with me! The rest of my fortune lies in my mansion in the Western Continent."

"I know your type. You would never keep all of your money in one place. Especially in a place like this. You must have a secret stash hidden somewhere around here in case of an emergency."

"This is all I have! I swear!"

"Fine."

I point my crossbow at his head.

"Wait! You're right! There's more. I've buried some gold next to that tree over there just to be safe. But that's the last of my money! I swear!"

I go over to the tree he was talking about and start digging out his treasure to verify that he's telling the truth. There's even more gold here than there was in his bag. I very much doubt that this is the last of his hidden stashes, but I'm probably not going to get any more info out of him at this point. I go back to where Kate and the duke of Bagelberry are standing.

"See?" says the duke. "It's all there! And it's yours now!"


[133]"Very well. I'll take your money in exchange for your life. Now get out of my sight. I never want to see you again."

"Y-Y-You'll never see me again! I promise!"

He scrambles to his feet and starts to run away.

Before he even takes his first step, however, a spike made of ice pops out of the ground, and impales him through his chest.

"Why?.. Why did--" he attempts to say, before his head drops to the side and his expression goes blank.

"Kate, what did you do?! I was trying to spare his life!"

"And you did. Congratulations! Thanks to you, his lifespan was extended by three whole seconds. You should be proud!"

"How could you do this? He was defenseless! He surrendered to us!"


[134]"A-Am I free to go?" he asks me.

"Yes, you are free," I tell him as I aim my crossbow at him and shoot him in the head. "Forever."

I take his bag of coins and the rest of his treasure and say to Kate:

"We're done here. Let's get back to our cave."


[135]"That was a sleeping dart, you know," Kate tells me as we make our way back to camp. "The dart you saved me from. I'm not sure what would have happened if you hadn't intervened."

She stops for a little and then looks at me.

"I owe you one, Barry. I won't forget this debt."

We spent the rest of our trip back in silence. But I didn't really find it awkward anymore. After all we've been through this morning, a bit of quiet is more than welcome.


[136]"That was a sleeping dart, you know," Kate tells me as we make our way back to camp. "The dart you saved me from. I'm not sure what would have happened if you hadn't intervened."

She stops for a little and then looks at me.

"That's twice I owe you now, Barry. Did you ever consider opening up a bank?"

"I'll give that a thought, after the end of the tournament."
 
We spent the rest of our trip back in silence. But I didn't really find it awkward anymore. After all we've been through this morning, a bit of quiet is more than welcome.


[137]"Actually, I'd rather help by fighting the enemies head on. Could you make an ice dagger for me?"

"Seriously?..."

Kate pauses a bit to reflect on my words.

"Fine, do as you wish," she says finally, as she conjures an ice dagger and hands it to me. 

When I grab it, I realize the hilt is also made out of ice, but its shape makes it easy enough for me to hold on to, and this is not the time and place to whine about how cold it feels in my hand.

She opens up her ice dome, as I step out and make a run for the forest.

Once I've passed through the smoke screen, I notice a man behind a tree, reloading his crossbow. His back is turned to me, and he didn't hear me coming yet.


[138]I stealthily approach him and when I'm close enough, I put my dagger to his neck, and slit his throat right open. He attempts to scream, but all he can manage is a weak gurgle, as he drowns in his own blood.

This is the first time I've killed a man. It was...


[139]...easy. Easier than I thought it would be. I was afraid I'd hesitate at the very last moment, but the thought never crossed my mind. My hands just instinctively moved the way they should have, and there were no awkward movements. This is a relief. I'll likely have to kill a lot more people before this tournament is over. It's good to know it isn't going to affect me.

The weak gurgle that the man let out before he died seems to have been enough to attract a fair bit of unwanted attention.

Five of the men that were shooting Kate are now rushing towards me, to see what happened. It will only be a matter of seconds before they see me. I need to act fast.

I quickly look around to see what are my options. I notice that the crossbow of the man I killed is in fact a repeating crossbow, and it was just reloaded with exactly five shots. If I aim my shots right, I might be able to take them all out.


[140]...necessary. I didn't exactly enjoy it, but it was either him or me. I'm sure he would have done the same to me without so much as the faintest trace of hesitation or remorse. In a battle, even the slightest hint of hesitation can prove fatal. We all joined this tournament knowing this. Knowing that we could die at any moment.

[141]...horrifying. As I felt his blood cover my hands, I couldn't help but think that what I've done could never be undone, and I felt like I could almost hear the desperate cries of his loved ones, as they would throw themselves over his lifeless body. That is to say, if his body will ever reach them. No... I can't let these feelings overwhelm me. I did what I had to do. Kate's in danger. I need to go on.

[142]I stealthily approach him and when I'm close enough, I hit him in the back of the head with the hilt of my dagger. Before losing his consciousness, however, he manages to let out a faint scream, which will no doubt alert some of the crossbowmen which are positioned closer.

Sure enough, five of the men that were shooting Kate are now rushing towards me, to see what happened. It will only be a matter of seconds before they see me. I need to act fast.

I quickly look around to see what are my options. I notice that the crossbow of the man I knocked unconscious is in fact a repeating crossbow, and it was just reloaded with exactly five shots. If I aim my shots right, I might be able to take them all out.


[143]I get as far away as I can from the crossbowman I took out, and hide behind a tree.

A few seconds later, I hear the five men's footsteps as they reach their friend.

"Who did this? Show yourself, coward!" shouts one of them.

"Maybe it's that banshee. Maybe she used her magic to get him."

"Don't be ridiculous, the banshee is barely even able to hold her ground."

While the men are arguing amongst themselves, I'm trying to find the right moment to distance myself from them. As I stand there and listen, with my back pressed against the tree, an arm appears from behind me, holding a knife in its hand. It quickly slices my neck, and blood starts pouring out.

"Like a rat in a cage, heheh..." I hear the man say, while I drop to the ground.

The last thing I see is the man's knife descending towards me, as he lands the finishing blow.


[144]

I quickly grab the crossbow from the ground, and jump right in front of the five men, aiming for the one in the middle.

My combat technique skill has taught me enough about vital organs in order to be able to shoot him in the chest without puncturing his lungs. I do the same for one of his comrades, and then I hide behind a tree, while three crossbow bolts fly right past me.

Three shots. I've only got three shots left. 

I jump out from behind the tree, and aim for the ones that are still standing. Instead of hiding behind trees themselves, the three uninjured men formed a wall in front of their fallen allies, in order to make sure I don't finish them off. This is good for me. It's much easier to aim for them when they're out in the open.

I fire two more shots, still making sure to not hit their vital organs, and both men drop to the ground with a loud thump.

The last man standing fires a bolt towards me, but I dodge it in the nick of time, and aim for him next.

Once I shot him, he fell to the ground like all the others, screaming in pain. I quickly made myself scarce, before their screams would attract other crossbowmen to this place. These ones were in no position to follow me.


[145]



I quickly grab the crossbow from the ground, and jump right in front of the five men, aiming for the one in the middle.

Afraid to not shoot him in one of his vital organs, I aim for one of his legs, in order to immobilize him. I do the same for one of his comrades, and then I quickly hide behind a tree, while three crossbow bolts fly right past me.

Three shots. I've only got three shots left. 

I jump out from behind the tree, and aim for the ones that are still standing. Instead of hiding behind trees themselves, the three uninjured men formed a wall in front of their fallen allies, in order to make sure I don't finish them off. This is good for me. It's much easier to aim for them when they're out in the open.

I fire two more shots, still aiming for their legs and both men drop to the ground with a loud thump.

The last man standing fires a bolt towards me, but I dodge it in the nick of time, and aim for him next.

I notice too late that one of the men lying on the ground managed to grab back his crossbow and is aiming it straight at me. 

There was no time for me to react.  His crossbow bolt hit me right in the face, and I died almost instantly.


[147]



I quickly grab the crossbow from the ground, and jump right in front of the five men, aiming for the one in the middle. I shoot him directly in the head, and before he even drops to the ground, I shoot one of his comrades as well, this time in his neck. As the two of them fall to the ground, lifeless, I hide behind a tree, while three crossbow bolts fly right past me.

Three shots. I've only got three shots left. 

I jump out from behind the tree, and try to aim for the ones that are still alive, but there's no one in sight. I realize they must have hidden themselves as well. As I try to figure out where they're hiding, one of them quickly pops out from behind a tree and shoots for my chest.

Luckily, I saw him before he took the shot, so I had the time to get out of his bolt's way. 

I shoot my attacker right through the heart, before he gets the chance to hide back behind his tree. I then spot one of the two other men, right before he jumps out. This time, my crossbow bolt hits him in the stomach, but the shot took him out, regardless.

The last man standing is visible, behind one of the trees. I'm not willing to wait for him to attack me first, so I take the shot.

My aim doesn't fail me, and the crossbow bolt pierces his temple, splattering the tree with his blood.

That was the last of them.

I didn't have the time to dodge the shot, but when it hit my chest, the bolt didn't quite manage to pass through the toughness of my skin and muscles, only giving me a slight injury instead.

[153]Once I calm down a bit, I suddenly realize that this was the first time I ever killed anyone. It was...


[154]...easy. Easier than I thought it would be. I was afraid I'd hesitate at the very last moment, but the thought never crossed my mind. My hands and my body just instinctively moved the way they should have, and there were no awkward movements. This is a relief. I'll likely have to kill a lot more people before this tournament is over. It's good to know it isn't going to affect me.


[155]...necessary. I didn't exactly enjoy it, but it was either them or me. I'm sure they would have done the same to me without so much as the faintest trace of hesitation or remorse. In a battle, even the slightest hint of hesitation can prove fatal. We all joined this tournament knowing this. Knowing that we could die at any moment.


[156]...horrifying. As I'm watching these blood stained corpses, I can't help but think that what I've done can never be undone, and I feel like I can almost hear the desperate cries of these men's loved ones, as they would throw themselves over their lifeless bodies. That is to say, if their bodies will ever reach them. No... I can't let these feelings overwhelm me. I did what I had to do. Kate's in danger. I need to go on.


[157]I take a glance towards the clearing, to see how Kate is doing. It seems she's given up on trying to aim through the smoke, and instead conjured some enormous fans made of ice that are currently in the process of blowing away all the smoke. 

As the smoke clears away, I can see hundreds of ice blades forming in the air, above Kate. She sends them flying all at once, in all directions. The crossbowmen didn't even know what hit them. They were dead before they got to lift their gaze. 

It appears she didn't really need my help after all. Since there's nothing left for me to do here, I go back to where Kate is standing.


[158]"Give me an ice dagger," I tell her.

"What?..."

"You heard me. Make an ice dagger for me. I'll deal with them myself."

"You're insane. What are you planning to do? Talk them all to death?"

"Either you give me that dagger, or I'm going in barehanded. The choice is yours."

Once Kate understands I'm not going to change my mind, she reluctantly forges an ice dagger and hands it to me. When I grab it, I realize the hilt is also made out of ice, but its shape makes it easy enough for me to hold on to, and this is not the time and place to whine about how cold it feels in my hand.

"Perfect," I say. "Now open up the dome. And make sure you keep it closed until I'm done. Just stay on the defensive for as long as you can. Don't take any stupid risks."

"Are you sure about this?"

"As sure as I can be, given the circumstances. Do it."

She creates an exit just wide enough for me to fit through, as I step out and make a run for the forest.

When I reach the woods, I notice a man behind a tree, reloading his crossbow. His back is turned to me, and he didn't hear me coming yet.


[159]





I quickly grab the crossbow from the ground, and jump right in front of the five men, aiming for the one in the middle. I shoot him directly in the head, and before he even drops to the ground, I shoot one of his comrades as well, this time in his neck. As the two of them fall to the ground, lifeless, I hide behind a tree, while three crossbow bolts fly right past me.

Luckily, I saw him before he took the shot, so I had the time to get out of his bolt's way. 


[160]Before I left, however, I took the liberty of swiping the ammunition of the first guy I took out. I am sure to need it shortly.

The first thing I need to decide now is what I'm planning to do with all of the crossbowmen I meet from this moment onward.


[161]I take the liberty of swiping the ammunition of the first guy I took out, and go on my way, without looking back.

The first thing I need to decide now is what I'm planning to do with all of the crossbowmen I meet from this moment onward.


[162]

Just because they tried to kill me, it doesn't mean I have to treat them the same way. They may have had legitimate reasons to work for the man with the high pitched voice and the loud horn. And they may have families waiting for them at home. I will go out of my way to make sure that none of the men I encounter from now on will die by my hand.

What I need to decide now is how I'm planning to take care of all these trained soldiers and mercenaries. I take a glance towards Kate. Her dome is still standing, but it's taking a lot of damage. All of the crossbowmen seem to be focused on her at this point, and they're not giving her any chance to retaliate. 

This means that I could try to take them all out by very quickly moving from one to the other, while they're distracted. Most of them are however stationed in groups, so there's no way to take them all out without getting myself killed unless I'm incredibly fast, or unless I can aim my crossbow while moving.

I could also try to snipe them from a distance, but I'd need to be pretty far for them to not be able to tell where the shots are coming from, and that kind of stunt would take significantly more time to pull off than any of my other viable strategies.

My eyes wander towards one of the many fallen trees around me, and suddenly a crazy thought comes to my mind. I bend my knees and try to lift the tree from the ground.


[163]

I didn't come here to become a mass murderer. But I am ready to kill if there is no other way. I am not going to risk my life and go out of my way to save some people who were ready to kill me at a moment's notice without so much as the slightest provocation on my part. However, I am going to try and not kill them unless it's absolutely necessary.

[164]

I see no reason to spare the lives of any of these people. They're trying to kill us for no reason at all, and they're not showing any hint of hesitation in doing so. It is only fitting that I pay them back in the same coin. I don't have the time to chase after every lone survivor, but I am most certainly not planning to hold back when I fight the lot of them.

[165]

The only way to be sure we win this fight is to kill every single one of them, especially their leader. If I leave any survivors, they might call for reinforcements. Who knows how many more of them are on standby, just waiting for some signal to flank us? I cannot take that risk. I won't let any of them make it out of here alive.

On that note, I realize I've let my feelings get the best of me in my previous fight.

I turn around, and head back towards where I fought the five crossbowmen, with my fully loaded crossbow in hand. 

As I reach the man I knocked unconscious with my dagger, I gaze upon him for a few seconds, and then I shoot him in the temple, giving him a swift and painless death.

The five of them are still rolling on the ground in pain. When they see me, some of them try to reach for their weapons. One of them manages to grab a hold of his crossbow, and tries to aim for me, with his arms shaking. I kill him first. I then proceed to execute his allies one by one. The last one alive begged me for mercy. I gave him no sign of having heard him, and I shot him in the head, without a second's hesitation.

It is done. I turn away, and start thinking of what I need to do next.

[169]

My eyes cannot believe what they are seeing. I just managed to lift the whole tree off the ground. And I'm pretty sure I could throw it too, if I wanted. This is insane. It must be weighing at least four hundred pounds. This is far beyond anything I would have dreamed to achieve with my stat device. This is superhuman.

With this kind of a weapon at my disposal, I might not even need speed or aim. There are fallen trees all around me. All I need to do is pick them up and use them to clobber someone, or even throw them at people.

At any rate, time is running out. I need to choose one strategy and stick to it.

There would however be no way to ensure there are no casualties if I go with this plan. Hell, it would be almost impossible to not kill people using something like this. If I choose to go with this plan, then I'll have to accept the fact that most people I attack will die by my hands. 

At any rate, time is running out. I need to choose one strategy and stick to it.


[171]

As expected, the tree won't budge. What was I thinking? It must be weighing at least four hundred pounds.

At any rate, time is running out. I need to choose one strategy and stick to it.


[172]Finally, I need to decide whether I want to go directly for the leader, or dispatch his troops first. If I capture the leader, then there's a chance I could persuade him to call off the attack, and end the fight sooner. However, if I fail to capture him, I'll only succeed in making myself the main target of his whole army.


[173]The quicker I finish this fight, the better. Taking out every single one of the men attacking us would take too much time, and I don't know if Kate can last much longer. I decide to head directly for their leader.

I go deeper into the forest, in order to avoid being detected, and I follow the general direction of where I first heard their leader talk. I doubt he had the reason to move from his original position, since he believes he's already won this fight.

As I run through the forest, I get spotted by a group of about ten men. Since they're relatively far away from me, they have to get closer to me in order to be able to aim their shots properly.


[174]I can't risk losing the advantage of the element of surprise. There is no better time than now to take the crossbowmen out, since they are all so focused on Kate. By the time their leader realizes what's happening, his army will be gone.

I start heading in the opposite direction of where I first heard their leader's voice come from, since my plan will be over if he notices me. I doubt he had the reason to move from his original position, since he believes he's already won this fight.

As I run through the forest, I get spotted by a group of about ten men. Since they're relatively far away from me, they have to get closer to me in order to be able to aim their shots properly.


[175]

I rush towards them and try to use my speed to outmaneuver them.

Sadly, I was nowhere near fast enough for such a tactic to work. Closing the gap between me and them only made it easier for the crossbowmen to shoot me down. They killed me before I even got the chance to reach my first target.


[176]

I rush towards them and try to use my speed to outmaneuver them.

This is not an easy task. Not by a long shot. When I first rushed towards them, I almost got shot by three crossbow bolts. They already greatly outnumber me. Closing in on them with a melee weapon when they've all got crossbows seems almost suicidal.

But speed is all I've got. I'm not confident enough to shoot my crossbow while moving, and if I stop for even a second, I'll get a crossbow bolt through my skull. I have to make it work. First of all, I need to single them out. I can't fight them all at once.

I use my superior agility to quickly distance myself from them, and make sure that they've completely lost my trace. I then start shooting my crossbow at several trees that are far apart from each other, in order to distract my attackers. A few of them take the bait, and get closer, to investigate the source of the sound.

These are not trained soldiers. At best, they could be some lowly personal guards. There's no way an organized group would ever break their formation because of a cheap trick like this.


[177]

I try to take advantage of the distance between us, by shooting them right away.

This strategy isn't working out as well as I had planned. I'm missing most of my shots and  wasting my ammo, while my enemies are getting closer. Maybe I should consider employing another tactic?


[178]

I try to take advantage of the distance between us, by shooting them right away.

I only now realize how amazing my eyesight has become. Even through this darkness, I can almost see my attackers' faces clearly. Aiming for them with my crossbow is a piece of cake. 


[179]

I make sure I don't stop moving for even a second, and I start shooting them with my crossbow. 

Unfortunately, even though they're all missing their shots, I'm not getting closer to hitting any of them either. Shooting people while I'm moving myself is a lot more difficult than I expected it to be. Maybe I should consider employing another tactic?


[180]

I make sure I don't stop moving for even a second, and I start shooting them with my crossbow. 

There are ten of them and one of me. I am not foolish enough to think that simply running around in circles is going to be enough to avoid being shot. Luckily, the stat device has also taught me ways to handle an uneven fight. The key is to constantly be aware of my surroundings. I need to not lose sight of any of my enemies, and know their whereabouts at any given time throughout the battle. 

By doing that, I make sure none of them manage to circle around me while others distract me. Knowing all of my enemies' location also helps me find their collective blind spots. If only two or three of them see me at a time, it makes it easier for me to dodge their shots. 


[181]

I make sure I don't stop moving for even a second, and I start shooting them with my crossbow. 

Unfortunately, even though they're all missing their shots, I'm not getting closer to hitting any of them either. Shooting people while I'm moving myself is a lot more difficult than I expected it to be. 

I don't really have the time to switch my tactics anymore, though, so it's all or nothing. As I move around, the crossbowmen are starting to take advantage of their superior numbers, and eventually manage to surround me. Once I have nowhere left to go, they execute me on the spot, by shooting all of their bolts into me simultaneously. I died on the spot.


[182]

I back away as much as I can and I try to take advantage of the distance I've just created between us.

This strategy isn't working out as well as I had planned, either. I'm missing most of my shots and  wasting my ammo, while my enemies are getting closer. 

Unfortunately I don't really have the time to switch my tactics anymore. It's all or nothing. I try to back away some more, but one of the men was waiting right behind me. Before I get the chance to react, he stabs me in the back, and I fall to the ground, unable to move from the pain. The last thing I see is the man's knife descending towards me as he lands the finishing blow.  


[183]

I back away as much as I can and I try to take advantage of the distance I've just created between us.

I only now realize how amazing my eyesight has become. Even through this darkness, I can almost see my attackers' faces clearly. Aiming for them with my crossbow is a piece of cake. 


[184]I look around me, and find a fallen tree that looks just about the right size for my intents and purposes. They won't be expecting this.

I lift the tree off the ground and throw it straight at my attackers. The tree hits five of them head on, and they get completely crushed under its weight. The rest of them are either screaming or simply stunned with shock.

"M-M-Monster! DIE!!!" screams one of them, as he shoots his crossbow at me.

I lift another fallen tree off the ground, and use it as a shield to defend me from his crossbow bolt. I then wield it as a club, and use it to smash his head into the nearest rooted tree. As I lift my oversized club to gaze upon my attacker, I notice that nothing remains of the man's head, except for the red paste splattered on the trees.
 
The other four men start screaming their lungs out. One of them is in such a hurry to leave that he trips and falls, another one literally pissed his pants, and the other two are running away as fast as their legs can carry them, and as far away from the battlefield as possible.


[185]I let them flee. I have no time to deal with cowardly deserters. The other two men soon follow in their allies' footsteps, and as they get farther away, they slowly fade into the darkness.


[186]First, I take care of the runners. Luckily for me, they are both running in a straight line, so I simply throw my tree towards them. They are too panicked to even think about looking behind them, so  they don't get a chance to get out of my projectile's way. The tree lands on both of them, and crushes them in an instant. 

Since I am running out of fallen trees that are light enough for me to lift, I lift a big boulder off the ground, and throw it at the man who tripped and fell while attempting to flee, and who is now making a second run for it. My swing had so much power behind it, that when the rock hit the crossbowman, it literally lifted him off the ground, and smashed him against a nearby tree's trunk.

The last man alive, the one who wet his pants, is now on his knees and bowing his head.

"P-P-Please! Mercy!" He says to me.

"No." I reply curtly, as I pick a branch off the ground, and smash his head in.


[187]I let them flee. I have no time to deal with cowardly deserters. The other two men soon follow in their allies' footsteps, and as they get farther away, they slowly fade into the darkness.

What followed was a massacre. There was no need for me to hide. No need for a strategy. I simply overwhelmed them with brute force. More than half of the enemy's battalion crumbled in a matter of minutes. The rest were too scared to fight anymore, and simply ran as fast as they could, in any direction, as long as it was as far away from me as possible.

But there was no escape from me. I left no survivors.


[189]I don't have the time to worry about vital organs right now, so I'm simply aiming for their legs. It should be enough to take them out of the fight.

One by one, the crossbowmen fall before me, while I keep backing away, deeper into the woods. Their shots are far off the mark. They're now trying to use trees as cover in an attempt to flank me. However, my observation skills seem to be so sharp now that I can even pay attention to multiple targets at the same time.

Whenever one of them tries to make a rush for the next tree, I take him out in an instant. Whenever one of them tries to circle around me, I snipe him from afar. 

In the end, only one of them remains standing. Seeing what happened to his comrades, he abandons his post and makes a run for it, trying to get as far away from the battlefield as possible.

I let him go. He's lost his will to fight. He won't be bothering me anymore.


[190]There is no need to hold back. I will shoot to kill, and they are in no position to stop me.

He might be fast, but he cannot escape my sight. I aim my crossbow for him, and shoot him in the back of the head, killing him instantly. 


[192]I don't have the time to worry about vital organs right now, so I'm simply aiming for their legs. It should be enough to take them out of the fight.

As I run, I pay close attention to each individual's crossbow. I count their shots, and calculate when they'll need to reload. I prioritize shooting the enemies that already have their weapons aimed at me and the ones that reloaded recently. 

One's down. And another. One by one, the crossbowmen fall before me, as they desperately try to keep up with my unpredictable movements. As their numbers dwindle, their resolve weakens, and their aim deteriorates.

[195]I cut a branch that looks solid enough to use as a blunt weapon from the tree behind me, and I wait for the crossbowmen to separate.

I start by targeting the splinter group with the fewer members.

In a split second, I reach behind them, and knock the first man out with a well placed hit of my improvised club. Before the second one even has the time to figure out what's going on, I knock him out as well, and then I hide behind the next tree. Fortunately, the other crossbowmen are too focused at what they're doing and haven't noticed that their allies have been taken out. 

This is perfect. It means I still have time to take out another group before they realize what's going on. I see my next targets, cautiously advancing towards one of the trees I shot earlier. There's three of them this time. I'd better be careful.

Just like before, I wait for a moment when they're all with their backs at me, I arrive behind them almost instantly, and before they have the chance to realize what's going on, two of them are already on the floor, unconscious. The third one, however, managed to parry my hit, and is now trying to aim his crossbow at my stomach.

[199]That was a bit too risky. I need to draw less attention to myself if I want to survive this fight. 

I start moving more cautiously, making sure I don't get detected until I get a clear view of all my enemies. When I encounter a larger group, I try to distract some of the men, and divide their attention. 

I then take them out methodically, by taking advantage of my steady aim and my superior tactics.

As I take out more and more of them, the crossbowmen are starting to gradually lose their will to fight, and are starting to flee the battlefield in greater numbers. They have no discipline. They're clearly not soldiers. I guess I was lucky at that. I'm not sure how well I'd have fared against actual trained professionals.

Taking out every single crossbowman that attempted to flee the battlefield has proven to be a bit time consuming, however. By the time I've finished all one hundred of them, Kate had sustained quite a few injuries. She looks pretty bloodied up, but at least she's still standing.

[205]The last man standing, their leader, is now on his knees, crying and begging me for mercy. By the looks of his fancy garments, he appears to be some rich noble from one of the more prosperous cities of the west. That would explain how he could motivate so many people to follow him on this suicide mission.

"Please!" He yells in his girly voice, while sobbing. "I only wanted to become famous by winning the tournament! I'm sorry I attacked you! Please, don't kill me! I have a lot of money! Here, you can take it. You can take it all! Just spare me my life. Please!"

He throws a bag of golden coins on the ground as he throws himself at my feet. This is quite a lot of money. I could easily live most of my remaining life in luxury with just this amount.


[206]I can't afford to keep running into enemies like this. My priority is their leader. I start moving more cautiously, making sure I get a clear view of my enemies before getting detected. I manage to avoid any resistance until I reach their leader's location. He's only got a handful of guards surrounding him. He was definitely not expecting an ambush. 

I take my time to silently neutralize all of the enemy's forces that are within hearing range of their leader, and then I quickly take out his personal guards, before they get the time to react. Their leader just realized what happened and is now screaming like a little girl. By the looks of his fancy garments, he appears to be some rich noble from one of the more prosperous cities of the west. That would explain how he could motivate so many people to follow him on this suicide mission.

"W-W-What are you doing here?" he asks. "How did you get here? Guards? Guards!"

"Nobody's coming to help you. All of the crossbowmen in hearing range of you have been taken care of. It's just you and me."

"N-N-No! Don't come closer. Stay back!"

I grab him by the tunic, to make sure I have his undivided attention.

"Listen to me. I don't care what country you're from, or how you got so many men to follow you here, but you are my hostage now. If you don't tell all of your troops to step out of the forest, drop their weapons and surrender, I am going to murderer you right here and now, and then I'll do the same to all of your guards."


[207]With the way he's acting, I doubt he'll ever muster up the courage to attack us again. 

"Very well. I'll take your money in exchange for your life. Now get out of my sight. I never want to see you again."

"Y-Y-You'll never see me again! I promise!"

He scrambles to his feet and runs away as fast as he can, without looking back. I watch him go until I make sure he's gone for good, then I grab the bag of coins and head towards Kate.


[208]With the way he's acting, I doubt he'll ever muster up the courage to attack us again. 

"I don't need your money," I tell him. "Just get out of my sight. I never want to see you again."

"Y-Y-You'll never see me again! I promise!"

He grabs his bag of money from the ground and runs away as fast as he can, without looking back. I watch him go until I make sure he's gone for good, and then I head towards Kate.


[209]I ignore his plead and shoot him in the head. He would have done the same to me in this situation. I take his money and I head towards Kate.


[210]I ignore his plead and shoot him in the head. He would have done the same to me in this situation. I decide to not take his money, since it's unlikely it will be of any use to me in this tournament and it will just weigh me down. I then head towards Kate.


[211]"You're telling me I can have all your money," I tell him. "But that's not all of your money is it? Where are you hiding the rest of it?"

"W-What do you mean? That's all I have with me! The rest of my fortune lies in my mansion in the Western Continent."

"I know your type. You would never keep all of your money in one place. Especially in a place like this. You must have a secret stash hidden somewhere around here in case of an emergency."

"This is all I have! I swear!"

"Fine."

I point my crossbow at his head.

"Wait! You're right! There's more. I've buried some gold next to that tree behind you just to be safe. But that's the last of my money! I swear!"

I step back and start digging out his treasure to verify that he's telling the truth. There's even more gold here than there was in his bag. I very much doubt that this is the last of his hidden stashes, but I'm probably not going to get any more info out of him at this point.

"See?" says the duke. "It's all there! And it's yours now!"


[212]"Very well. I'll take your money in exchange for your life. Now get out of my sight. I never want to see you again."

"Y-Y-You'll never see me again! I promise!"

He scrambles to his feet and runs away as fast as he can, without looking back. I watch him go until I make sure he's gone for good, then I grab the bag of coins and the rest of his treasure and head towards Kate.


[213]"A-Am I free to go?" he asks me.

"Yes, you are free," I tell him as I aim my crossbow at him and shoot him in the head. "Forever."

I take his bag of coins and the rest of his treasure and head towards Kate.


[214]As I approach the battlefield, I am shocked to see that all of the men that came out of the forest to surrender have since been summarily executed.

"Kate, what did you do?" I ask her.

"I offered them a quick and painless death. Isn't that what they said they'd give us if we surrendered?"

"But did you have to kill every single one of them?"

"Yes, I did."

She sighes.

"Listen, Barry. I know you might not be used to this, but you have to understand. We're not in a situation where we could realistically hold such a large number of prisoners. And it's not like they've done anything illegal, so we couldn't turn them over to the local authorities, either. If we had tied them up and left them here, then they'd just have died of hunger or been killed by someone else. If we'd simply let them go, then they were sure to come after us for revenge at a later date. There was no other way."

"You're right. I would have probably done the same. I guess we're done here, then. Let's go back to our cave."

"I'll be honest," says Kate, as we make our way back to camp. "I didn't really expect you to pull it off."

"Yeah. Neither did I."

"That's twice I owe you now, Barry. Did you ever consider opening up a bank?"

"I'll give that a thought, after the end of the tournament."

We spent the rest of our trip back in silence. But I didn't really find it awkward anymore. After all we've been through this morning, a bit of quiet is more than welcome.

[218]As I approach her, Kate calls out to me.

"What happened? Why aren't they shooting anymore?"

"Because I took care of them."

Kate looks like she needs a moment for that to sink in.

"You took care of ALL of them?"

"Yeah. They won't be bothering us anymore. Now let's go back to our cave. We're done here."

[222]

Just because they tried to kill me, it doesn't mean I have to treat them the same way. They may have had legitimate reasons to work for the man with the high pitched voice and the loud horn. And they may have families waiting for them at home. I will go out of my way to make sure that none of the men I encounter from now on will die by my hand.

What I need to decide now is how I'm planning to take care of all these trained soldiers and mercenaries. I take a glance towards Kate. Her dome is still standing, but it's taking a lot of damage. All of the crossbowmen seem to be focused on her at this point, and they're not giving her any chance to retaliate. 

This means that I could try to take them all out by very quickly moving from one to the other, while they're distracted. Most of them are however stationed in groups, so there's no way to take them all out without getting myself killed unless I'm incredibly fast, or unless I can aim my crossbow while moving.

I could also try to snipe them from a distance, but I'd need to be pretty far for them to not be able to tell where the shots are coming from, and that kind of stunt would take significantly more time to pull off than any of my other viable strategies.


[223]

I didn't come here to become a mass murderer. But I am ready to kill if there is no other way. I am not going to risk my life and go out of my way to save some people who were ready to kill me at a moment's notice without so much as the slightest provocation on my part. However, I am going to try and not kill them unless it's absolutely necessary.

[224]

I see no reason to spare the lives of any of these people. They're trying to kill us for no reason at all, and they're not showing any hint of hesitation in doing so. It is only fitting that I pay them back in the same coin. I don't have the time to chase after every lone survivor, but I am most certainly not planning to hold back when I fight the lot of them.

[225]

The only way to be sure we win this fight is to kill every single one of them, especially their leader. If I leave any survivors, they might call for reinforcements. Who knows how many more of them are on standby, just waiting for some signal to flank us? I cannot take that risk. I won't let any of them make it out of here alive.

On that note, I realize I've let my feelings get the best of me in my previous fight.

I turn around, and head back towards where I fought the five crossbowmen, with my fully loaded crossbow in hand. 

As I reach the man I knocked unconscious with my dagger, I gaze upon him for a few seconds, and then I shoot him in the temple, giving him a swift and painless death.

Who knows how many more of them are on standby, just waiting for some signal to flank us? I cannot take that risk. I won't let any of them make it out of here alive.

On that note, I realize I've let my feelings get the best of me in my previous fight.

I turn around, and head back towards where I fought the five crossbowmen, with my fully loaded crossbow in hand. 

The five of them are still rolling on the ground in pain. When they see me, some of them try to reach for their weapons. One of them manages to grab a hold of his crossbow, and tries to aim for me, with his arms shaking. I kill him first. I then proceed to execute his allies one by one. The last one alive begged me for mercy. I gave him no sign of having heard him, and I shot him in the head, without a second's hesitation.

[229]At any rate, time is running out. I need to choose one strategy and stick to it.


[230]"Why not?"

"See for yourself. Go on, try and head back to our cave."

Hesitantly, I start retracing my steps back towards the cave. Once I start walking, however, I get a powerful urge to go the other way.  I try again and I get the same result. No matter how many times I try, I simply can't keep going in the same direction. I keep turning in the opposite direction, sometimes, without even noticing. Is this some sort of spell? In all of my research, I've never read of such a thing.

"What did you do?" I ask Kate.

"I see. Apparently not even someone as learned as you would be familiar with this spell. It is understandable. They don't really use suggestion magic outside the continent of Varathia after all. The spell I used is part of a subset of magic called suggestion. What these spells do is that they insert an idea inside your head, and they make you think you were the one that came up with it. You may have noticed that something was wrong because you were specifically aiming to go in that direction, but most mages wandering around this area won't even notice the spell's effect."

"But how do I get around it?"
