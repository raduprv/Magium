[2]"This is where I wanted to bring you. Please, tell me what you can tell by studying the magic in this place..."

As I concentrate on the nature of the magic around me, I start sensing strong traces of elemental magic.

"It seems there's been at least one elementalist battling here," I tell her.

"Yes, but can you tell which element the caster was using?"

I try to focus even further. 

"It's uh... I'm not sure how to describe it. It doesn't seem to be any of the four traditional elements. If I were to put it into words, I'd say it would be... electric, in nature."

Kate's face slowly lights up when she hears my words. This is the first time I've seen her smile, even if only slightly, ever since we've first met.

"Thank you, stillw-- Barry... You've really been a great help!"

Her reaction took me by surprise.

"Wow. This is the first time I see this side of you. I didn't know you could actually be... nice."

"What's that supposed to mean?"


[3]"Kate, I think this afternoon's events have been too much for the poor boy. He's gone completely delirious. You think you could knock some sense into our dear companion, here?

"No," Kate answers, curtly.

"Because you won't be bothered to--"

"Because he's right. The device he's carrying is indeed a stat booster, and most of those stats are meant to amplify his physical attributes."

"What?... Weren't you the one saying I shouldn't trust him just a few hours ago? Why are you defending him, now?"

"I'm not defending anyone. I've known the true function of these devices for a long time.  I don't need to trust him in order to know he's telling the truth."

"Fine, I give up. You win, Barry. So what are these stats of yours, anyway?"


[4]"No," Kate answers, curtly.

"Because you won't be bothered to--"

"Because he's right. The device he's carrying is indeed a stat booster, and one of those stats gives the owner knowledge of the ancient languages."

"What?... Weren't you the one saying I shouldn't trust him just a few hours ago? Why are you defending him, now?"

"I'm not defending anyone. I've known the true function of these devices for a long time.  I don't need to trust him in order to know he's telling the truth."

"Fine, I give up. You win, Barry. So what are these stats of yours, anyway?"


[5]"Because if you're good at observing details, you're far more likely to detect illusions. Usually, the best way to know you're in an illusion is to notice something minor that changed in the environment around you. No illusion is perfect. Sometimes there's a few leaves that disappear from the ground, some other times the sun is higher in the sky than it was before you entered the illusion. I'm really bad at noticing these kinds of things. Usually I only see it when it's too late. That hasn't killed me yet, but then again, I've never had to fight against the strongest mages in the world before. Even if you max all of your physical attributes, I doubt you'll ever be on par with me and Kate, let alone all the other mages that joined this tournament. But with good observation skills, you might well end up saving our lives when we enter our first illusion."

Daren pauses.

"Well, anyway, that's just my opinion. You can take it with a grain of salt. That little trinket is yours to use, so feel free to do whatever you want with it! However, I want you to decide now and tell us what you're going with, so that we can prepare our tactics accordingly. We can't afford to go into our next fight without a plan."

"I hope I'm not interrupting anything important," says Elaria as she approaches. "I thought you might be hungry after such a long journey."

She pushes a big plate of cooked meat towards us with her front hoof. Judging by the looks and smell, it appears to be... deer meat.


[7]Kate was caught off guard by Elaria's proposal. She's struggling to form a coherent sentence in the deer's language.

"I... did not... know that you... spoke Common."

"I can understand it, but I am not allowed to speak it. The great fox has forbidden us to speak in the humans' language ever since the hunts of Olmnar began, a few decades ago.  Humans and animals on this continent had been living in harmony for hundreds of years, but it all changed when the people of Olmnar started hunting animals as a sport some forty years ago. That is when the great fox decided to sever all ties between the animal kingdom and the humans, and forbade us to speak the Common language ever again."

"So... not allowed.. speak .. us?" 

"Technically I shouldn't be talking to humans in general , but the only rule set in stone is that I'm not allowed to speak in the common language. I respect the great fox, and her decisions, but that does not mean I agree with all of them. I fear that the rift that has grown between our two races will only further amplify the conflict between us. Most humans have forgotten the art of food conjuration, and without us to help them, they have started turning to more primitive methods of acquiring food. What used to be only a sport practiced by Olmnar, has now become a means of survival for many humans. This war has already cost us so many lives,  including Molan's father, and I am getting more and more tired of it with each passing day..."

"Technically I shouldn't be talking to humans in general , but the only rule set in stone is that I'm not allowed to speak in the common language. The great golden fox is a very old spirit that has guided all animals on the continent for thousands of years. She is our protector, our shepherd and our teacher, and we all aspire to be like her.

[9]Elementalists are mages born with incredible talent at manipulating one of the four elements: water, air, fire or earth. However, they are born with the affinity for only one element, and they usually have problems mastering other spells, since they rely solely on their talent for casting their elemental spells, and generally have little knowledge of the arcane arts.

Summoners are mages who concentrate on summoning other creatures to fight for them. Since that leaves them vulnerable to surprise attacks, they will usually also focus on defensive spells, to keep them safe while their summoned creatures fight for them. 

Shapeshifters on the other hand go for a more personal approach, transforming themselves into other creatures instead of summoning them. This solves the vulnerability problem that summoners have, but it also limits their powers, as they are unable to cast other spells while transformed.

"What about you, Kate," Daren asks. "Do you have any weaknesses against any particular kinds of magic?"

"Yes," she answers.

"But you don't plan on sharing them with us."

"I do not."


[10]Weapon enchanters use their magic to make their gear as strong as possible. Since they mostly rely on their weapons for combat, they will likely also train themselves in at least one martial art.

[12]Listening to him tell me all these stories made me realize why I defended him instinctively from Cutthroat Dave yesterday. Even though I never really thought about it before, I guess I always kind of admired him. He's like all of those heroes from the fairy tales I used to read when I was a kid, and he's a living example of what I've always aspired to become.

"I've been in a lot of places over the years, Barry. But everywhere I go, it's always the same. The weak are oppressed by the strong, the few are killed by the many. Everywhere I go, there's people dying from starvation, plague, war, or some monster invasion. I've seen death all my life, but I never get used to it. Seeing all of those dead bodies just lying there, lifeless, yesterday... It made me feel an intense pain in my chest. It was as though I could feel the suffering of each of them, and the fear that went through their hearts as they took their last breath. What about you, Barry? What did you feel when you saw all those dead people?"


[13]As we stand guard,  Daren starts telling me stories about his travels around the world, and the adventures he's had. He tells me of the fifty foot giants that live in the far east of the Northern Continent. He tells me how he's cured the dreaded Iknar plague of the Eastern Continent by himself, and how he defeated the green wyvern of the north.

[14]"Just promise me something," I tell him.

"Of course!"

"Promise me that you won't try to purify her until you see her transform into a banshee."

Daren sighs.

"You're asking a lot of me, Barry.  You should know better than anyone how hard it will be to stop her once she turns into a banshee. But if it means that much to you, then I'll promise."

He pauses.

"Come on, we should get going. It's time we wake up Kate so she can take second watch."

As we descend towards the cave, my stat device starts beeping. I pull it out of my pocket, and I see that I now have six more points available to spend. There must have been a big fight somewhere in the vicinity.

[16]"I want you to carry this with you at all times. If you're ever in danger, just tap this three times, and I'll come over to help as fast as I can."

"Just promise me something," I tell him.

"Of course!"

"Promise me that you won't try to purify her until you see her transform into a banshee."

Daren sighs.

[17]She's being serious. This must be more important to her than she lets on.

"Why are you asking this of me and not Daren? He's the legendary mage around here, not me!"

"Because unlike him, you appear to be very knowledgeable in the more obscure intricacies of magic. You don't see many people these days that know how a stat booster works. Plus, I have something I want to ask you in private. So come, before we wake up Daren."

We exit the cave and head for the trees. The moon is still pretty high up in the sky. It can't have been more than two or three hours since I went to sleep.

As we walk in awkward silence for a few minutes, I figure I might as well try to start a conversation.

[20]"Daren said he'd met a banshee before," I lie to her. "He said he could tell you were different somehow, and that he was going to keep an eye on you, for the time being."

"I see," Kate says with relief in her voice. "That's all I wanted to ask. Let's keep going, then."

"Wait, why ask me all of this? Why not ask Daren directly?

"Because Daren is the one that knows white magic, not you. He is the one who would normally want to purify a banshee. I didn't want to give him any ideas, in case the thought never occurred to him."

"And why would you believe that I'm telling the truth?"

"Because you're not a very good liar.  Your face gives you away."

Is that so?...

[24]"You speak to me of agony and despair, but you chose to become a mage. Surely you must understand how I feel about this?"

"I do not. Because becoming a mage was never my intention. And I have no intention of continuing this conversation, either. I gave you a warning. You can choose to heed it or you can ignore it. This is all I'm willing to say on this subject."

Before giving me a chance to respond, she storms ahead as I rush to follow her. We travelled in complete silence for the next ten minutes.

As we get further and further away from the cave, I call out to her again.

"Wait," I tell her.

"What is it now?"

"We're getting too far away from our cave. What if anyone attacks Daren while he's asleep?"

"Oh, you don't need to worry about him."


[25]"In order to counteract the spell, all you need to do is focus on the cave, and visualize it clearly inside your head when you head towards it. As long as you have a set destination inside your head and not simply a general direction, the spell won't work on you. My knowledge of this spell was one of the only reasons I was able to survive against banshee hunters for so long. It covers a pretty large area, but unfortunately I can only cast it about two times a day, and it doesn't last for more than a few hours. Now let's go, our destination lies not much farther." 

After about five more minutes of walking, we finally come to a halt. The area we stopped in is full of fallen trees, similar to the one where we fought yesterday. Except this time there are no bodies. However, there's clearly been a big battle here. Perhaps even the battle that charged up my stat device before going to sleep. I can still feel the traces of leftover magic resonating strongly in the air around me.

"This is where I wanted to bring you. Please, tell me what you can tell by studying the magic in this place..."

As I concentrate on the nature of the magic around me, I start sensing strong traces of elemental magic.

"It seems there's been at least one elementalist battling here," I tell her.

"Yes, but can you tell which element the caster was using?"

I try to focus even further.

Kate's face slowly lights up when she hears my words. This is the first time I've seen her smile, even if only slightly, ever since we've first met.

"Thank you, stillw-- Barry... You've really been a great help!"

Her reaction took me by surprise.

"Wow. This is the first time I see this side of you. I didn't know you could actually be... nice."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

[28]"Surrender, banshee!" says the man with the high pitched voice. "We have you surrounded. There's no way you can tell where we are through this thick smoke. If you surrender, we'll grant you and your human companion the gift of a quick and painless death!"

Yet another enemy who doesn't believe I'm a stillwater. I'm starting to doubt that this bluff was a good idea after all.

"Is this a joke?" says Kate. "I can sense that there's at least a hundred of you hiding behind the trees all around us. And yet none of you are mages. Do you seriously think you can win against mages by outnumbering them?"

"Mages are no gods. They bleed just like the rest of us. If they bleed, they can be killed. And so can you."

After he finishes his phrase, he blows a very loud horn which drowns out all other sounds in the woods, and suddenly a rain of crossbow bolts comes flying towards us from every direction. Kate quickly makes an ice dome around us to block their shots.

"Barry, can you see them through the smoke?"

I take a look through her semi-transparent ice dome, and try to see if I can distinguish any figures through the distant smoke screen. It appears that even with all of the unfavorable circumstances, I can still see our enemies clearly enough. This observation stat is truly amazing.

"Barry," she says. "You need to listen to me closely, because I can't hold this dome for much longer. I need you to go back to our camp as fast as you can and call Daren. There's no way we can win this fight otherwise."

As she speaks, one of Kate's eyes is twitching, and there is sweat dripping all over her face. 

"You can't be serious! You'll never survive for that long. You're barely even keeping yourself awake."

"I'll manage. I've been in far worse situations and made it out alive. Plus, even if I get injured, Daren can heal me when the fight is over. Now hurry up, time is not on our side."

[33]"Good gods, Barry, just how far did the two of you wander off?" asks Daren as we run towards Kate.

I give him no answer and I start running faster. When we reach our destination, we notice everything is completely silent, and there's a lot of dead bodies in our way. Once we get within eyeshot of Kate, we start to understand why there are no noises coming from the battlefield. Kate is sitting on her knees, with her head bowed down, and both of her hands holding the hilt of an ice sword thrust into the ground. Both Kate and her ice sword are full of blood, and the ground all around her is littered with dead bodies. As she hears us approach, she raises her head slightly to look at us and says:

"I'm sorry, where are my manners? I should have left at least a few survivors for the two of you."

As she finishes her sentence, she lets go of her sword and falls face first on the ground.

"Kate!!!" shouts Daren as he rushes to her side. He starts casting his healing spell, but he appears to be having difficulties. After a few minutes, he finishes his spell, but Kate still hasn't woken up, and some of her wounds have not closed.

"This kind of damage isn't going to just disappear with a simple healing spell," Daren says. "She'll need quite some time to fully recover. At least she's no longer in any mortal danger. Would you mind telling me how the two of you got the bright idea to wander so far away from our camp without waking me up?" 


[34]She sends another cone of ice, which goes right through his head.

"He's dead. Alright, err, the next one is--"

"This is taking too long," Kate interrupts me, while conjuring floating ice shields left and right to defend us from the onslaught of crossbow bolts. "I have an idea."

She creates two huge fans made of ice, right above the smoke screen on our left side, and they start moving by themselves and blowing the smoke away.

"It's working," she says, as she conjures a few more to deal with the remainder of the smoke.

"NO!" shouts the man with the high pitched voice. "Don't let her blow away the smoke!"

It's too late, though. There are already hundreds of ice blades forming in the air, above Kate. She sends them flying all at once, in all directions. The crossbowmen didn't even know what hit them. They were dead before they got to lift their gaze. 

One last crossbowman who managed to survive the onslaught is now making a run towards us, in a desperate attempt to get behind Kate and to shoot her before she notices him. Kate remains unphased, and she shoots an ice cone straight into his head, sending his corpse tumbling to the ground, while his crossbow drops from his hands and lands a few feet behind me.


[35]"How could you do this? He was defenseless! He surrendered to us!"

"Yes, and I offered him a quick and painless death. Isn't that what he said he'd give us if we surrendered?"

"That doesn't mean we have to act like him!"

Kate sighs.

"Listen, Barry," she says. "I didn't kill this man for petty revenge. I killed him because once he would've calmed down, he'd have started procuring himself a new army, and he would have likely made it his mission to hunt us down, so that he could take HIS petty revenge on us. This was visibly a very resourceful man. It's not easy to convince a whole battalion of men to follow you to certain doom. I highly doubt he was the kind of person to easily let go of a grudge, either. And as I pointed out earlier, he most definitely didn't strike me as the merciful type. Don't you think we're in enough danger as it is, without adding some enemies that are looking to kill us, specifically?

"I, uh... I didn't think of it that way."

"No. You didn't. Now come on. Let's go back to our cave. We're done here." 

I take the bag of coins and follow Kate.

[38]I fire two more shots, still aiming for their legs, and both men drop to the ground with a loud thump.

The last man standing fires a bolt towards me, but I dodge it in the nick of time, and aim for him next.

I notice too late that one of the men lying on the ground managed to grab back his crossbow and is aiming it straight at me. 

For a moment, it felt like time had stopped in its tracks. I could see the crossbow bolt in mid-air, as it was heading towards me. I quickly side-stepped to the left, and I could almost feel the wind from the bolt, as it flew past my head. I then immediately aimed my crossbow for the last man still standing. 

Once I shot him, he fell to the ground like all the others, screaming in pain. I quickly made myself scarce, before their screams would attract other crossbowmen to this place. These ones were in no position to follow me. 


[39]I pull the bolt out of my chest and I shoot my attacker right through the heart, before he gets the chance to hide back behind his tree. I then spot one of the two other men, right before he jumps out. This time, my crossbow bolt hits him in the stomach, but the shot took him out, regardless.

The last man standing is visible, behind one of the trees. I'm not willing to wait for him to attack me first, so I take the shot.

My aim doesn't fail me, and the crossbow bolt pierces his temple, splattering the tree with his blood.

That was the last of them.

I miss the shot. And that was my last one. I don't have the time to reload, so I rush towards my target, with the ice dagger in my right hand.

The man was surprised by my speed, and didn't get the chance to take aim properly. When I got close enough, I stabbed him in the neck, drenching my hand in his blood, and killing him on the spot.

That was the last of them.

Unfortunately I wasn't fast enough. The man saw me coming and he shot me right in the face, avenging his fallen comrades. The shot killed me instantly.

[44]It is done. I turn away, and start thinking of what I need to do next.

What I need to decide now is how I'm planning to take care of all these trained soldiers and mercenaries. I take a glance towards Kate. Her dome is still standing, but it's taking a lot of damage. All of the crossbowmen seem to be focused on her at this point, and they're not giving her any chance to retaliate. 

This means that I could try to take them all out by very quickly moving from one to the other, while they're distracted. Most of them are however stationed in groups, so there's no way to take them all out without getting myself killed unless I'm incredibly fast, or unless I can aim my crossbow while moving.

I could also try to snipe them from a distance, but I'd need to be pretty far for them to not be able to tell where the shots are coming from, and that kind of stunt would take significantly more time to pull off than any of my other viable strategies.

My eyes wander towards one of the many fallen trees around me, and suddenly a crazy thought comes to my mind. I bend my knees and try to lift the tree from the ground.

[47]I slash his hand with my ice dagger , and he is forced to drop his weapon. I attempt to knock him out again with my club, but he simply blocks my hit again, and reaches for his own knife. 

I've already decided that I'm not going to kill anyone in this fight, and I'm not going to back out of it now. No matter what happens, I am not ending this man's life. The man lunges at me with his knife, but I dodge his hit, and try to knock him out again. This time, he grabs a hold of my arm,  and he twists it until it breaks. The pain of it breaks my concentration, and I am unable to dodge the next strike of his knife, which hits me right in the stomach. As I struggle to stay on my feet, the man casually picks up his crossbow from the ground and points it at my face. His expression shows nothing but contempt.

"You overestimated yourself, boy," he says, as he pulls the trigger.

His face is the last thing I see, before my consciousness fades completely. 


[48]I slash his hand with my ice dagger , and he is forced to drop his weapon. I attempt to knock him out again with my club, but he simply blocks my hit again, and reaches for his own knife. 

This is getting serious. I can't afford to prolong this fight any longer. This time, I strike to kill.  The man tries to lunge at me with his knife, but I dodge his hit, and use my dagger to slit his throat. I jump back, as some of his blood sprays on me, and he falls to the ground, instinctively trying to cover his neck with his hands for a few seconds, before his body inevitably stops moving and his facial expression goes blank.

Two of the other men saw what happened, and are rushing towards their fallen comrades. I take advantage of this to quickly circle around them, and I take them out without giving them any chance to retaliate. I take out two others just as easily, and in the end, there's only one man still left standing. Seeing what happened to his comrades, he abandons his post and makes a run for it, trying to get as far away from the battlefield as possible.

I let him go. He's lost his will to fight. He won't be bothering me anymore.


[49]I slash at his hand, and he is forced to drop his weapon. He tries to reach for his own knife, but I am too fast for him. One slash of my dagger is all it takes to take care of him.

He might be fast, but he cannot escape my sight. I aim my crossbow for him, and shoot him in the back of the head, killing him instantly. 


[51]"No, wait! I can't!"

"Of course you can. That horn you're holding in your hand also doubles as a magical voice magnifier, does it not? Now hurry up. I think my trigger finger may be slipping."

He reluctantly puts the voice magnifier to his mouth, and calls out to his troops.

"Attention, all men! This is the duke of Bagelberry speaking. I have just been captured by the enemy. I repeat, I have just been captured by the enemy. You are all to step out of the forest, throw down your weapons and surrender!"

The forest falls silent, as the crossbowmen's relentless attacks towards Kate suddenly come to a halt. They are confused, that much I can tell.

"Didn't you hear me?! As your ruler, I COMMAND you to come out of that forest and drop your weapons! Now!"

After a small delay, the first couple of crossbowmen start stepping out of the shadows, followed by a wave of a few dozen more men. Eventually they all step out of the forest, and throw their weapons at Kate's feet, declaring their surrender.

"There, I did what you asked!" says the duke. "Now will you let me go?"

"And why would I do that? The way I remember it, all you offered us if we surrendered was a quick and painless death."


[52]"I... suppose you're right." I tell her, hesitantly. "I guess we're done here, then. Let's go back to our cave."

"I'll be honest," says Kate, as we make our way back to camp. "I didn't really expect you to pull it off."

"Yeah. Neither did I."

"That's twice I owe you now, Barry. Did you ever consider opening up a bank?"

"I'll give that a thought, after the end of the tournament."

We spent the rest of our trip back in silence. But I didn't really find it awkward anymore. After all we've been through this morning, a bit of quiet is more than welcome.


[53]"Listen, Barry. I know you might not be used to this, but you have to understand. We're not in a situation where we could realistically hold such a large number of prisoners. And it's not like they've done anything illegal, so we couldn't turn them over to the local authorities, either. If we had tied them up and left them here, then they'd just have died of hunger or been killed by someone else. If we'd simply let them go, then they were sure to come after us for revenge at a later date. There was no other way."

"I... suppose you're right." I tell her, hesitantly. "I guess we're done here, then. Let's go back to our cave."

"I'll be honest," says Kate, as we make our way back to camp. "I didn't really expect you to pull it off."

"Yeah. Neither did I."

"I owe you one, Barry. I won't forget this debt."
