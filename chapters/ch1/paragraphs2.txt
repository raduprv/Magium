[2]"This is where I wanted to bring you. Please, tell me what you can tell by studying the magic in this place..."

As I concentrate on the nature of the magic around me, I start sensing strong traces of elemental magic.

"It seems there's been at least one elementalist battling here," I tell her.

"Yes, but can you tell which element the caster was using?"

I try to focus even further. 

"It's uh... I'm not sure how to describe it. It doesn't seem to be any of the four traditional elements. If I were to put it into words, I'd say it would be... electric, in nature."

Kate's face slowly lights up when she hears my words. This is the first time I've seen her smile, even if only slightly, ever since we've first met.

"Thank you, stillw-- Barry... You've really been a great help!"

Her reaction took me by surprise.

"Wow. This is the first time I see this side of you. I didn't know you could actually be... nice."

"What's that supposed to mean?"


[3]Taking a closer look at the mage in armor, I notice his head is bald, his skin is dark, he is likely in his mid forties and he has a scar on his forehead, shaped like an 'X'.  I've read of a mage matching this exact description who went by the name of Daren, and he was quite legendary, but would he lose so easily to some common thug? The mage in the white shirt answers my question as he addresses the one in armor, while casually playing with one of his knives.

"The legendary mage Daren! The savior of the Eastern Continent. The healer in armor. They say you've travelled the world, saving countless villages from destruction. That you've once fought ten rock golems by yourself, only to defend a small child. I guess this goes to show, you should never really trust legends, aye? I always knew all of those tales about mages as strong as giants were just codswallop. Hell, if all those 'legendary' mages that joined this tournament are as weak as you, I'm going to win this by sundown!"

He starts laughing but he stops suddenly.

"Wait, who's there?" he says, as he turns towards me.

I quickly pull my head back behind the tree, and press my back against it, trying to breathe as silently as possible.

"I know you're there, coward. Show yourself, or I'll have one of my knives find you!"

[5]It seems the two mages have just finished fighting. One of them has the appearance of an ordinary thug. He is wearing a simple stained white shirt, leather pants and a belt full of throwing knives. His untrimmed black beard hides a wicked smile. Just by seeing the confidence in his eyes, I can clearly tell he is the victor of the skirmish. The other mage is wearing heavy armor, but his shield lies on the ground besides him and he is barely holding his sword anymore.

[6]Stillwaters are a very rare breed of mages, that are known to be incredibly powerful. One of them is said to have destroyed an entire city in an instant some twenty years ago, with only a flick of his fingers. The city of Olmnar was said to have been one of the greatest cities on this continent, but it was wiped off the map just like that, in a single second. Such is the power of these stillwaters.

But what is even more interesting about these stillwaters is that you can't differentiate them from normal humans. Normally, you can sense the magic flowing from every being. You don't need to be a mage to do it. By sensing their magical aura, you can tell how strong mages are before engaging them in a fight. 

Stillwaters, however, have the same aura as normal humans. And if you were to run into someone that seems to have almost no magic in the middle of what is essentially the greatest mage tournament in all of history... What would you be more inclined to believe? That an average human was somehow suicidal enough to join the tournament only to get massacred? Or that you are facing one of the strongest and rarest kinds of mages that exist in the world?

"You don't scare me, stillwater! I'm going to fill you with holes and you'll end up begging me for mercy! I bet your legends are no more true than they were for this sad excuse for a mage standing next to me."

[9]"You had no obligation to save me," he says. "But you did so anyway, at the risk of your own life. I cannot let such selflessness go unrewarded. I, Daren, vow this day that I will offer you my protection from this moment, and until the end of this tournament. Tell me, brave soul, what is your name?"

His speech took me by surprise.

"It's, uhh... It's Barry. My name is Barry."

"Wait, your name's Barry?"

He tries to contain his laughter but fails miserably. He was trying to sound solemn and dignified just a few seconds ago, but it seems it didn't really take him long to drop his act.

"Now that's the weirdest name for a mage I've heard in my life. Especially for a stillwater. Do you have something you want to tell me, Barry?"

[12]He demonstrates it by raising his hands in the air and making a white light appear all around him. As the light shines, his wounds start closing, and the blood fades away. He then uses the same magic to heal the shoulder wound I'd gotten from Cutthroat Dave's knife.

"The cutthroat's knives had a life of their own, and there were many of them attacking me simultaneously. If I had a proper shield spell to defend against them, defeating him would have been child's play. But defending against all those knives with a shield and sword alone would have been impossible regardless of my combat skill. All armors have their weaknesses. All he had to do was go for the armor's joints repeatedly, until he wore me out."

"Why are you telling me all of this? Shouldn't you be at least a bit worried about revealing your greatest weakness to someone you just met?"

"Hey, you just saved my life! So you can't be that bad, right?"

"Pardon me for interrupting," I hear a woman's voice from behind the trees. "But would you by any chance be Daren, the legendary savior of the eastern continent?"

[14]I'm after the prize that's being offered to the winner. The Magium.

Nobody knows exactly what it looks like, or what it's made of, but everyone knows the fact that it is the source of all magic in the world, and that it can only be found on the continent of Varathia. All mages seek it. They crave it. They are certain that if they have access to it, they can increase their powers a hundredfold and become living legends. And although it is a common misconception that the Magium is only useful for learned mages, my studies have led me to believe that the Magium is so extraordinary that it can even turn a normal human into a mage.

I've searched very long for a way to get into Varathia, but the only way one can travel to their continent is by receiving a direct invitation. Very few of those are sent yearly, and the people being teleported there are being held under direct supervision for the duration of their stay, and return with no information regarding the coordinates of the place.

But when all hope seemed lost, the announcement came. A worldwide announcement by the kings of Varathia that they were organizing a tournament where every single mage in the world was invited. And the winner would be granted access to the Magium.   

I knew then that there would never be another chance like this. 

"Why did you join this tournament, Barry?" Daren asks me again.


[15]"Don't worry, I'll make sure to keep you safe until we reach one of the cities!"

"I'm not so sure about that. I mean, I just witnessed you get completely wrecked by that knife throwing guy. How does one as strong as you get bested so easily by someone named Cutthroat Dave, anyway?"

"Oh, that..."

He is sounding embarrassed.

"You see, Barry. I may be powerful, but that doesn't mean I don't have weaknesses. It turns out one of those weaknesses is that I never really managed to master the shield spell properly..."

"The shield spell? The one that casts an invisible protective layer around yourself? But isn't that one of the first spells any mage learns?"
