[2]"This is where I wanted to bring you. Please, tell me what you can tell by studying the magic in this place..."

As I concentrate on the nature of the magic around me, I start sensing strong traces of elemental magic.

"It seems there's been at least one elementalist battling here," I tell her.

"Yes, but can you tell which element the caster was using?"

I try to focus even further. 

"It's uh... I'm not sure how to describe it. It doesn't seem to be any of the four traditional elements. If I were to put it into words, I'd say it would be... electric, in nature."

Kate's face slowly lights up when she hears my words. This is the first time I've seen her smile, even if only slightly, ever since we've first met.

"Thank you, stillw-- Barry... You've really been a great help!"

Her reaction took me by surprise.

"Wow. This is the first time I see this side of you. I didn't know you could actually be... nice."

"What's that supposed to mean?"


[3]"Where's the stillwater?"

"Gone. I just saw him kill Cutthroat Dave along with a whole crew of henchmen. Turns out he can cast fire magic, combustive magic and teleportation without even breaking a sweat. Eiden got upset because Cutthroat Dave mistook him for me, and I took advantage of the situation."

"Hah! Serves him right! But how did I end up unconscious on the ground?"

"You mean you don't remember? He just waved his hand casually and put you to sleep."

"What?... That can't be right. I have so much protection against sleep spells that I should be almost immune. At the very least I should be able to keep my consciousness! And what was that about him using fire magic? I'm pretty sure he used air magic on me when we first met him. Normally it takes a lifetime to master even a single element!"


[4]After we're done talking, Kate takes a few moments to reflect on our words.

"So, let me see if I got this right..." she says. "Barry, you traded our lives for one message."

"Right," I say.

"And we need to deliver this message to any robed men we might encounter that wear a brooch with a picture of a hawk holding the sun in its talons."

"Yeah. Does that description tell you anything?"

"Yes..." she says, and then almost immediately looks towards the ground.

She's hiding something again. I just know it.

"They're an underground group," she continues. "Most of the time they don't really show themselves in public. Nobody knows exactly who they are, or what they do. Most people don't even know they exist. But there are rumors that they are being backed by the kings of Varathia."

"They're being backed by the kings?" Daren asks. "What would Eiden want with these hotshots? You simply have to tell them to remember the still winter, right? I wonder what that's supposed to mean?"


[5]I give him the device, and he looks at it intently for a few seconds.

"Are you going to do somethin--"

"Shush!"

He picks up a rock from the ground and throws it at a nearby pine tree. The rock hits its mark and bounces off, leaving a slight dent in the tree's bark.

"I thought something here was wrong," Daren says. "Look at that dent. You could barely tell I was using a stat device right now. But that throw of yours from earlier... That was insane! It was so strong that it lifted the cutthroat right off the ground and slammed him into a tree. How are you getting so much power out of this?"

"I'm... not sure. I thought it was just reacting to the incredible quantity of magical power around us. There must be something about me specifically that makes the stat booster work so well. But without knowing exactly how it functions, it's hard to tell what that might be."

"Hmm..."

He hands me back the device.

"I guess there's no use standing here throwing out guesses, then. We'll figure it out later. Let's go get Kate."

The two of us head for our cave and proceed to wake Kate from her slumber.


[6]"Yes..." she says, and then almost immediately looks towards the ground.

She's hiding something again. I just know it.

"They're an underground group," she continues. "Most of the time they don't really show themselves in public. Nobody knows exactly who they are, or what they do. Most people don't even know they exist. But there are rumors that they are being backed by the kings of Varathia."

"They're being backed by the kings?" Daren asks. "What would Eiden want with these hotshots? You simply have to tell them to remember the still winter, right? I wonder what that's supposed to mean?"


[7]"When did I ever say something like that? All I'm saying is we don't have enough information to make any viable strategies against him at this point. Until we find some weakness to that magic of his, we should be grateful for the time Barry's bought us with his trade, however long it may last."

"Maybe you're right. Hopefully the time Barry's bought for us will be enough to find out Eiden's weakness."

"Kate," I say. "Do you have a minute?"

Kate is looking at me, confused.

"Of course," she says, finally, and then she follows me outside the cave.

As we make our way out, Daren winks at me and gives me a thumbs up. Leave it to Daren to completely misinterpret this kind of a situation. Sometimes I wonder if he even understands body language at all.

"I'm going to ask you directly," I tell Kate once we reach the cave's entrance. "What is the Beacon of Hope?"


[8]"So, what? Does that mean we should all just bow down to him now and become his lackeys?"

"When did I ever say something like that? All I'm saying is we don't have enough information to make any viable strategies against him at this point. Until we find some weakness to that magic of his, we should be grateful for the time Barry's bought us with his trade, however long it may last."

"Maybe you're right. Hopefully the time Barry's bought for us will be enough to find out Eiden's weakness."

He turns to me.

"Barry, did you have any luck finding those medicinal herbs you needed to cure your sister's illness?"

"No... Nothing of the sort, just yet. I'm keeping my eyes peeled."

Kate frowns at me.

"Alright," Daren says. "Let me know if you need any help."

"Barry," Kate says. "May I have a word with you, in private?"


[9]"So, what? Does that mean we should all just bow down to him now and become his lackeys?"

"When did I ever say something like that? All I'm saying is we don't have enough information to make any viable strategies against him at this point. Until we find some weakness to that magic of his, we should be grateful for the time Barry's bought us with his trade, however long it may last."

"Maybe you're right. Hopefully the time Barry's bought for us will be enough to find out Eiden's weakness."

He turns to me.

"Barry, I think we should start heading for one of the cities. We should focus on getting you home as soon as possible. It's not like they've announced the objectives yet, so we should have enough time. I'm pretty sure I saw a road sign that pointed towards one of the cities on our way here."

"Oh, uh... That's a good idea. We should totally do that!"

Kate frowns at me.

Barry,"  she says. "May I have a word with you, in private?"


[10]"When did I ever say something like that? All I'm saying is we don't have enough information to make any viable strategies against him at this point.

"Alright," Daren says. "Let me know if you need any help."

"Barry," Kate says. "May I have a word with you, in private?"


[13]Kate's determination from her eyes has now been replaced with uncertainty.

"What do you know about the Beacon of Hope?"

"Not much, really. Eiden just said you're a survivor from that place, but he wouldn't give us more details. He said we should ask you in person. So what is this Beacon of Hope, then?"

She hesitates.

"It's... complicated."

"Uh huh. See what I meant? You're hiding stuff from Daren too. How's that any different from what I'm doing?"

"It is different. And you should tell Daren the truth. But you're free to do what you want. That's all I had to say on the matter."

With these last words, she turns her back on me and storms back into the cave.


[14]"It won't."

"How can you be so sure?"

She looks away, for a second.

"It just won't."

She pauses.

"I'm... not planning to keep this a secret forever. It's just... this isn't the right time. I promise I will make all things clear in due time. Now, if that's all you wanted to discuss with me, I'll be going back to sleep."

She heads back inside the cave, but I do not follow her. Instead, I lie down with my back against the cave's outer wall and start to collect my thoughts.

A lot has happened since I joined this tournament. People are dying left and right, and the organizers are not even bothering to give us our objectives. And to top it all off there's that stillwater. What could he possibly look to achieve by joining a tournament like this? What is his purpose?


[15]"Oh," Daren says. 

His eyes are a lot colder than usual.

"Well, now I know."

"Now you know..."

Kate is smiling at me faintly, but Daren is looking more serious than I've ever seen him before. I decide to give him some time to think about what I've said, and I head back towards the cave's entrance.


[16]"And that story about your sister, that was all a lie too?"

"Yes..."

"Oh," Daren says. 

His eyes are a lot colder than usual.

"Well, now I know."

"Now you know..."

Kate is smiling at me faintly, but Daren is looking more serious than I've ever seen him before. I decide to give him some time to think about what I've said, and I head back towards the cave's entrance.


[17]"If it makes any difference, I think you made the right decision. There's no way of knowing for sure what will happen if we break the non interference rule."

"Thanks. But it's too late to worry about that, now. We can't just abandon Daren like that. Let's go."

As we catch up with Daren, we're surprised to see that there are no more monsters in the vicinity.

"Look who decided to show up," says Daren.

"What happened? Where are the goblins?" I ask him.

"They all ran away scared at the sight of me. They weren't the bravest bunch. I didn't even get to pull out my sword."

I look around, to see if the woman that was screaming got hurt in any way. When I get a good look at her, I am briefly stunned by just how beautiful she is.  She has long auburn hair, a thin waist and a warm smile, while her facial features are soft and feminine, unlike those of Kate, and her light-brown eyes radiate kindness. She is wearing an auburn dress to match her hair, and she appears to be somewhere in her mid twenties. The woman is now bowing elegantly before us, as a gesture of gratitude.

"Thank you all so much for your help," she says. "I don't know what I would have done without you!"

[19]"Miss Kate, I was out here looking for some very rare herbs that only grow in this area of the continent. There's been an outbreak of oildrip in my hometown, and as a herbalist, I can recognize the plants that are needed for the cure."

"I'm sorry, what's an oildrip?"

"Oh, I did not know this disease does not exist outside of our continent. The doctors are unsure of its cause, but what happens is that the patients' sweat becomes as thick as oil, and they get a very high fever, with violent coughing. Some of us have a natural immunity to it, but those that are not so lucky get quarantined somewhere and left there to die on their own. The only cure we know of for this disease is extracted from the very rare plants that I've come here to collect."

"But why are you the one that came here to get the herbs? Do you have members of your family that are infected? Why didn't you at least hire some bodyguards to go with you?"


[20]Rose smiles, and she continues.

"But why are you the one that came here to get the herbs? Do you have members of your family that are infected? Why didn't you at least hire some bodyguards to go with you?"


[21]"We were banished from our clan two days ago. We did not have money to pay our yearly tribute. Now, we are outcasts. We live from scraps. We don't even know how to tell the difference between poisonous and edible berries so we can't live off the land."

"How much was the yearly tribute for the four of you?"

"Two copper pieces."

Two copper pieces? That's barely the price of a loaf of bread. Come to think of it, goblins can't really work for humans openly since they are considered monsters. There are people that are known to smuggle goods and weapons to goblins, but they are rare, and operate outside the law. It shouldn't be surprising that money is a lot more valuable for them than for us.

I have money to spare, but the question is, do I want to give even two copper pieces away to some monsters who attacked a defenseless woman just a minute ago?


[22]"I overheard you talking about having trouble distinguishing between edible and poisonous berries, and I thought I might be able to help!"

"You can... understand us too?"

"Yes, although not as good as this man standing beside me. I only got half of what you were discussing, but enough to understand why you attacked me back there. I am a herbalist, so I know quite a bit about plants. Although I can't teach you all I know, I can tell you a general rule that you can follow in order to make sure you don't get poisoned. You should stick to blue berries, as they are common enough to be found in any region of this continent, and even the most poisonous of them only give you a stomachache at most. As for finding the ones that are not poisonous, it is enough to look for blue berries that are of a dark color. Only light blue berries are dangerous."

She eats one of the dark blue berries she is holding in order to demonstrate she's not lying, and then throws a bag full of them over to the goblin leader. 

"Here, I'm sure you will make much better use of these berries than I will. I only just ate. And please, don't attack defenseless people anymore."


[23]"You can... understand us too?"

[24]As the goblins leave, I turn around to see that Daren is frowning hard, and rubbing his forehead, while Kate is just standing there, looking at us with her jaw dropped.

"Alright," says Daren. "Can someone explain to me what just happened?"

The woman laughs softly.

"I'm sorry," she says. "I realize his whole situation might have seemed really strange if you didn't understand what we were saying. In short, they've been exiled from their clan two days ago due to lack of money and they had to resort to petty theft in order to not die of hunger, so we helped them as much as we could! But, where are my manners? My name is Rose. Thank you all so much for your help. I don't know what I would have done without you!"


[25]The goblin puts his left hand on his stomach, and his right hand on his chest. The rest of the goblins mimic his gestures, and they all say together:

"Tunak Madar!"

Tunak Madar... If I'm not mistaken, from what the stat device has taught me, I gather that this is one of the highest forms of respect and gratitude that exists in their language. It has no translation in any other languages that even comes close to its meaning.

"Alright," says Daren. "Can someone explain to me what just happened?"

But, where are my manners? My name is Rose. Thank you all so much for your help. I don't know what I would have done without you!"


[26]"Kate," says Kate, as she points toward herself. She then curtly points towards me and then Daren, giving Rose our names as well.

Rose smiles, and she continues.

"Miss Kate, I was out here looking for some very rare herbs that only grow in this area of the continent. There's been an outbreak of oildrip in my hometown, and as a herbalist, I can recognize the plants that are needed for the cure."

"But why are you the one that came here to get the herbs? Do you have members of your family that are infected? Why didn't you at least hire some bodyguards to go with you?"


[29]"With the risk of asking something obvious, who is the Creator?" asks Daren.

"Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot how little information about us reaches the other continents. The Creator was... the founder of our civilization. Everything we are today, we owe to him. He and the spirit protector of all animals, the great golden fox decided together six hundred years ago to end all war and hunger, uniting the human and animal kingdom, and leading them into an age of peace and prosperity. They taught both humans and animals how to create what they needed with magic, and thus eliminated the need for work and conflict. Food, water, warmth, shelter, every one of those things could be obtained through magical means. From what I hear, it must have been paradise."


[30]Now that she mentions it, I can hear a faint whistling, although I don't recognize the tune. It's getting closer. Suddenly the music stops, just as the whistlers get in visual range of us. There's three of them. Weapon enchanters by the looks of them. They seem cleaner than Cutthroat Dave's group, and they don't smell like them, but other than that, they don't look much different. They'll probably attack us on sight like all the others.

And here I thought we'd filled our quota of pointless fights for today. 

"Clive, do you see that?" says one of the men.

"By the gods, it's a banshee," says another.

The third man starts screaming, and falls on his back.

"Monster! Kill the monster!" yells one of them, with sheer terror in his voice.

Kate doesn't seem to be taking this very well. She is looking towards the ground, but this time it's not anger I see in her eyes. If I were to guess, I'd say she's feeling miserable.

The man named Clive is now rushing and screaming towards Kate, with the sword in his hand, ready to run her through. Daren readies his own sword, but before he gets to act, it is Rose that puts herself between Kate and the attacking mage.

[32]"No!" Daren shouts, as he runs towards Rose.

At the same time, Kate extends her arm towards Clive, and an ice cone is slowly coming out of her palm.

Clive quickly slashes his knife at Rose's face, and she instinctively closes her eyes. The mage stops his strike mere inches away from his target, and his whole body starts vibrating loudly, as it gets enveloped in a white light.

"Ah, shi--" he starts to say, but he gets teleported out of the continent, and away from the tournament.   

 "What did you do to Clive, you filthy-- YYARGHH"

The man who started to talk was immediately interrupted by one of Kate's cones of ice that went through his right shoulder.

"Normally, I wouldn't think twice about killing scum like you," Kate says. "But I'd rather spare Rose from witnessing a gruesome bloodbath. So I'm offering you a chance to retreat. What do you say?"

The man with the ice cone in his right shoulder is grinding his teeth.

"Forget the banshee," he says to his comrade. "Let's get the hell out of here!"

Once the two of them get far enough away, Kate turns to Rose and says:

"I've changed my mind. I would be honored to serve as your escort until you reach your hometown. I'm sorry for having misjudged you. What you just did was very brave and heroic."


[33]Kate is blushing. This is the first time I've seen her blush since I've met her yesterday. It kind of suits her.

"I can see why," Daren says, grinning. "Barry's been smitten with Kate ever since he first laid eyes on her."

"You what?!" Kate asks me, taking Daren's joke a little too seriously.

"Hey, now," says Daren. "You'll have to continue this conversation later, in private! Now that there's four of us, we'll need to rethink our battle strategy. We need to make sure nothing happens to Rose if we encounter any monsters on our way to her hometown."

And so, we ended up spending the rest of the morning on discussing different tactics and stratagems.
