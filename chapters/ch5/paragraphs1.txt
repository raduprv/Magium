"Daren!" I shout. "Daren, can you hear me?"

"Barry? Wait right there! I'm coming for you!"

Well, it's not like I'm going anywhere. My knees still hurt like hell. I've barely even budged from my original position to avoid more pain. Eiden sure did a number on me. 

"Barry! What happened?!" Daren says when he sees me.

"Oh, not much. Just a little parting gift from our mutual friend."

"Eiden!" says Daren, while clenching his fist.

He casts a healing spell on me and I suddenly get enveloped in a warm, soothing light. The pain leaves me completely, and I manage to get back on my feet with no difficulty. I always knew there were healing spells like this, but witnessing one of them first hand is something else. Most healers I've met in my lifetime could barely even heal light bruises or ankle sprains.


[274]

"Daren!"

There's no answer.

"Hey, Daren!"

Daren suddenly wakes up and starts looking around him, confused.

"What happened? Where's the stillwater?" he asks me.

"That's the second time you ask me these exact questions. He's gone. He vanished right after he put you to sleep."

"Put me to sleep?... No, that can't be! I have so much protection against sleep spells that I should be almost immune. At the very least I should be able to keep my consciousness!"

"Well I'm just telling you what I saw. I don't claim to understand it either."

"So would you two mind telling me who that stillwater was?" Kate asks us. "And what was that trade he was going on about?"

Daren and I start filling her in on the details of our first encounter with Eiden.


[275]

"Daren!"

There's no answer.

"Hey, Daren!"

Daren suddenly wakes up and starts looking around him, confused.

"What happened? Where's the stillwater?" he asks me.

"That's the second time you ask me these exact questions. He's gone. He vanished right after he put you to sleep."

"Put me to sleep?... No, that can't be! I have so much protection against sleep spells that I should be almost immune. At the very least I should be able to keep my consciousness!"

"Well I'm just telling you what I saw. I don't claim to understand it either. At any rate, I think we should wake up Kate. She needs to hear what happened, and we could use another strategy meeting right about now."

The two of us head for our cave and proceed to wake Kate from her slumber.


[276]

"Barry!" Daren calls out to me again as he approaches the trees.

"I'm over here," I answer him.

He enters the forest, and starts looking around for Cutthroat Dave.

"Where's the cutthroat?"

"If you look hard enough, you can still see some of his ashes near that rock over there."

"Ashes?... Don't tell me that device of yours gives you fire powers now too."

"It wasn't me, it was the stillwater. Eiden came back and burned Dave to a crisp just as he was about to finish me off. He said it wasn't fitting for a mailman to die before he gets out of the post office."

"Wait, you're saying he used fire magic? Didn't he use air magic that time when he pinned me to the ground? Normally it takes a lifetime to master even a single element!"


[277]

"Daren!"

There's no answer.

"Hey, Daren!"

Daren suddenly wakes up and starts looking around him, confused.

"What happened? Where's the stillwater?" he asks me.

"That's the second time you ask me these exact questions. He's gone. He vanished right after he put you to sleep."

"Put me to sleep?... No, that can't be! I have so much protection against sleep spells that I should be almost immune. At the very least I should be able to keep my consciousness!"

"Well I'm just telling you what I saw. I don't claim to understand it either. At any rate, I think we should wake up Kate. She needs to hear what happened, and we could use another strategy meeting right about now."

"Not so fast, Barry. I want to have a look at that stat device of yours, first."

"Huh? What's gotten into you all of a sudden?"

"Just hand it over for a second, will you? I want to test something."


[278]

"Daren!"

There's no answer.

"Hey, Daren!"

Daren suddenly wakes up and starts looking around him, confused.

"What happened? Where's the stillwater?" he asks me.

"That's the second time you ask me these exact questions. He's gone. He vanished right after he put you to sleep."

"Put me to sleep?... No, that can't be! I have so much protection against sleep spells that I should be almost immune. At the very least I should be able to keep my consciousness!"

"Well I'm just telling you what I saw. I don't claim to understand it either."

"Wait a minute... Didn't we just see him cast fire magic too? There's something seriously wrong here. I'm pretty sure he used air magic on me the first time we met. How could he know two types of elemental magic? Normally it takes a lifetime to master even a single element!"


[279]"Maybe he has some artifact that's helping him?"

"No, that can't be it. If that were the case, we would have either seen him wear it or felt its magical aura when he was this close. Besides, most offensive magical items are used as weapons, and he was definitely not holding anything in his hands."

"At any rate, I think we should wake up Kate. She needs to hear what happened, and we could use another strategy meeting right about now."

The two of us head for our cave and proceed to wake Kate from her slumber.


[280]"Maybe he's older than he looks?"

Daren pauses a bit to ponder on my question.

"You might be onto something there, Barry," Daren tells me. "When I fought him, he could anticipate every one of my moves, and he didn't even bother to use magic to avoid my first few strikes. Most battle hardened warriors would have had a hard time dodging even the first slash of my sword. I'm not really sure how we could figure out what his real age is, however."

"Maybe we could ask him?"

"Ask him? Have you lost your senses?"

"Why do you say that? It's not like he has any reason to hide his real age from us. And he doesn't seem to have a problem with switching between attempted murder and casual conversation."

"Sometimes I wonder about you, Barry..."

"At any rate, I think we should wake up Kate. She needs to hear what happened, and we could use another strategy meeting right about now."

The two of us head for our cave and proceed to wake Kate from her slumber.


[281]"Maybe he made a pact with some god?"

"Don't believe everything you read in fairy tales, Barry. I've yet to hear of a real pact between a god and a mortal, and I'm most definitely not inclined to believe that any of the gods would have bothered to so much as acknowledge that punk's existence."

"At any rate, I think we should wake up Kate. She needs to hear what happened, and we could use another strategy meeting right about now."


[282]Once she's up, we start filling her in on all that's happened since Eiden showed up.

After we're done talking, Kate takes a few moments to reflect on our words.

"So, let me see if I got this right..." she says. "Barry, you traded our lives for one message."

"Right," I say.

"And we need to deliver this message to any robed men we might encounter that wear a brooch with a picture of a hawk holding the sun in its talons."

"Yeah. Does that description tell you anything?"

"Yes..." she says, and then almost immediately looks towards the ground.

She's hiding something again. I just know it.

"They're an underground group," she continues. "Most of the time they don't really show themselves in public. Nobody knows exactly who they are, or what they do. Most people don't even know they exist. But there are rumors that they are being backed by the kings of Varathia."

"They're being backed by the kings?" Daren asks. "What would Eiden want with these hotshots? You simply have to tell them to remember the still winter, right? I wonder what that's supposed to mean?"


[283]It takes us a while, but we eventually manage to awaken her, and we start filling her in on all that's happened since Eiden showed up. 

After we're done talking, Kate takes a few moments to reflect on our words.

"So, let me see if I got this right..." she says. "Barry, you traded our lives for one message."

"Right," I say.

"And we need to deliver this message to any robed men we might encounter that wear a brooch with a picture of a hawk holding the sun in its talons."

"They're being backed by the kings?" Daren asks. "What would Eiden want with these hotshots? You simply have to tell them to remember the still winter, right? I wonder what that's supposed to mean?"


[284]It took us more than a minute to awaken her. Once she got up we could see that she was still in a terrible shape. It seems that not even healing magic can work miracles. It'll probably be another day until she fully recovers after this morning's ordeal.

We start filling her in on all that's happened since Eiden showed up.

After we're done talking, Kate takes a few moments to reflect on our words.

"So, let me see if I got this right..." she says. "Barry, you traded our lives for one message."

"Right," I say.

"And we need to deliver this message to any robed men we might encounter that wear a brooch with a picture of a hawk holding the sun in its talons."

"Yeah. Does that description tell you anything?"


[285]"It sounds like a threat to me. It would most certainly fit Eiden's way of doing things as we've seen it so far. He sends us to fight his enemies, and then has a good laugh about it afterwards."

Kate nods.

"I agree," she says. "He wouldn't have left us alive just to send a message to some old friends. A veiled threat to some old enemies, on the other hand seems much more likely. I'm not sure what the still winter is, exactly, but I'm willing to bet that we'll get attacked the moment after we've finished saying the words."

"So, we either fight a whole underground group backed up by this continent's royalty, or we fight a crazy overpowered maniac who can evaporate us in the blink of an eye. The good news is that there's no time limit. If we could just manage to avoid meeting these robed gentlemen until the end of the tournament, we could be in the clear!"

"Now hold on, there," Daren says. "There's no reason to assume that the message is a threat just from the phrase's wording. Besides, I think that what's more important right now is to figure out a way to beat Eiden, not talk about his message!"

"And how do you suggest we do that, exactly?" Kate says. "It only took him half a second to put you to sleep, and I'm pretty sure that your protections are better than mine in that department. That alone would be enough to take us all out, but I hear he has a whole arsenal of other spells in his pocket."

"So, what? Does that mean we should all just bow down to him now and become his lackeys?"


[286]"It sounds like a threat to me. It would most certainly fit Eiden's way of doing things as we've seen it so far. He sends us to fight his enemies, and then has a good laugh about it afterwards."

Kate nods.

That alone would be enough to take us all out, but I hear he has a whole arsenal of other spells in his pocket."


[288]"It sounds like a coded message to me. I think it's referring to something that only Eiden and these robed men know, so that they can meet up somewhere or take a certain action."

"I agree," Daren says. "He wouldn't want us to know where they'll be meeting or what they'll be doing after all."

"I don't think the stillwater would have spared our lives just to send a message," Kate says. "He must have some other hidden reason we're not aware of. The way he phrased this message... It sounds more like a threat to me. What if they attack us right after we tell them these words?"

"Now hold on, there," Daren says. "There's no reason to assume that the message is a threat just from the phrase's wording. Besides, I think that what's more important right now is to figure out a way to beat Eiden, not talk about his message!"

[290]"It sounds like a coded message to me. I think it's referring to something that only Eiden and these robed men know, so that they can meet up somewhere or take a certain action."

"I agree," Daren says. "He wouldn't want us to know where they'll be meeting or what they'll be doing after all."

"So, what? Does that mean we should all just bow down to him now and become his lackeys?"


[291]"Err... Of course," I say, and I follow her out of the cave.

As we make our way out, Daren winks at me and gives me a thumbs up. Leave it to Daren to completely misinterpret this kind of a situation. Sometimes I wonder if he even understands body language at all.

Once we're at the cave's entrance, Kate stops in front of me, and looks me straight in the eye with that serious determined look of hers.

"You lied to Daren about your true purpose in joining this tournament, didn't you?"

"And what if I did?"

"Why would you hide this from him? Do you seriously think he'll consider you an enemy just because you're competing for the same prize? And even if he did, do you really think he'd have any reason to fear you?"

"Everybody lies. Everyone has something to hide. You're no different. It's not like you ever told Daren about the Beacon of Hope, did you?"


[292]"Err... Of course," I say, and I follow her out of the cave.

As we make our way out, Daren winks at me and gives me a thumbs up. Leave it to Daren to completely misinterpret this kind of a situation. Sometimes I wonder if he even understands body language at all.

"Everybody lies. Everyone has something to hide. You're no different. It's not like you ever told Daren about the Beacon of Hope, did you?"

"That's not the same thing!"

"How so?"

She pauses for a few seconds and then decides to completely ignore my question.

"You should tell Daren the truth. But I'm not going to force you. You're free to do what you want. That's all I had to say on the matter."

With these last words, she turns her back on me and storms back into the cave.


[293]She pauses for a bit to look me straight in the eye. 

"How do you know about the Beacon?" she asks me.

"Eiden told us you're a survivor from that place shortly before attacking Daren. He wouldn't give us any details, though. He said we should ask you personally. So what is it, then?"

"It's... complicated."

"No doubt. There's no need to tell me the full story. A short summary will do."

"Do you really have nothing better to do than to meddle in my personal affairs?"

"If it were just a matter of privacy then I wouldn't have brought it up. But it's not, is it? You've been hiding things ever since we first met. It was the same when I asked you about the robed men Eiden is looking for. I'm asking you because I don't want this secrecy of yours to end up killing us all."


[294]"Do you really have nothing better to do than to meddle in my personal affairs?"

"If it were just a matter of privacy then I wouldn't have brought it up. But it's not, is it? You've been hiding things ever since we first met. It was the same when I asked you about the robed men Eiden is looking for. I'm asking you because I don't want this secrecy of yours to end up killing us all."

"It won't."

"How can you be so sure?"

She looks away, for a second.

"It just won't."

She pauses.

"I'm... not planning to keep this a secret forever. It's just... this isn't the right time. I promise I will make all things clear in due time. Now, if that's all you wanted to discuss with me, I'll be going back to sleep."

She heads back inside the cave, but I do not follow her. Instead, I lie down with my back against the cave's outer wall and start to collect my thoughts.

A lot has happened since I joined this tournament. People are dying left and right, and the organizers are not even bothering to give us our objectives. And to top it all off there's that stillwater. What could he possibly look to achieve by joining a tournament like this? What is his purpose?


[295]Maybe Kate's right. What was I thinking when I lied to Daren like that? He's shown me nothing but honesty so far, and I've betrayed his trust. He's going to get upset about this, but I'd rather tell him the truth now than have him find out later on his own.

"Daren, I have something to tell you," I say as I enter the cave.

Kate, who was preparing to go back to sleep, is now watching me intently, waiting to see if I'm really planning to go through with it.

"Hey, now, Barry, you really shouldn't start a conversation like that. Usually, conversations that start with these words never end up well."

I take a deep breath.

"I wanted to tell you that I lied to you yesterday, about the real reason I'm here. The truth is that nobody forced me to come to this place. I came here of my own free will. I came here because I want to win this tournament. Because it's been my dream ever since I was a kid to become a mage, and the Magium can grant me that wish. I'm sorry I haven't been honest with you about this."


[296]Maybe Kate's right. What was I thinking when I lied to Daren like that? He's shown me nothing but honesty so far, and I've betrayed his trust. He's going to get upset about this, but I'd rather tell him the truth now than have him find out later on his own.

I take a deep breath.

"I wanted to tell you that I lied to you yesterday, about the real reason I'm here. The truth is I didn't come here looking for medicinal herbs. I came here because I want to win this tournament. Because it's been my dream ever since I was a kid to become a mage, and the Magium can grant me that wish. I'm sorry I haven't been honest with you about this."


[297]As I sit there and think,  I suddenly hear a woman's scream coming from far in the distance. At the same time, I get a warning message floating in front of my eyes, telling me to not hurt her because she's one of the locals. 

Although she's pretty far away from here, judging by the faint traces of magic that are coming from her direction it is safe to assume that she's being attacked by monsters. They don't seem to be very big, or particularly powerful, so we're likely talking about a handful of goblins.   

The rules of the tournament are a bit hazy on what would happen if we were to save one of the locals from a monster attack. The general rule is to not intervene at all in the affairs of the people of Varathia, but it's not being enforced through a spell, like the rule that prevents us from directly hurting them for example.

From a logical perspective, it would be less risky to not intervene. There's no way to know for certain that taking an action here would not get me banned from the tournament. But then...

The woman screams again, this time louder, and sounding more terrified.

The woman screams again, this time louder, and sounding more terrified.

 
[299]No matter what Kate says, I have no way of knowing how Daren will react if he hears I'm actually aiming to win this tournament like everybody else. And besides, if he finds out I've been lying to him all this time, he'll only get more upset. I have no choice but to continue lying to him, at this point.

I lie down with my back against the cave's outer wall and start to collect my thoughts. A lot has happened since I joined this tournament. People are dying left and right, and the organizers are not even bothering to give us our objectives. And to top it all off there's that stillwater. What could he possibly look to achieve by joining a tournament like this? What is his purpose?


[300]I did not come here to play the hero. Winning the tournament takes priority. I mustn't forget that. If there's even the slightest chance that saving this woman could get me kicked out of the tournament, then I should not interfere.

"What's that noise?" Daren asks as he comes closer to the cave's entrance.

"One of the locals is being attacked by a group of monsters. Probably goblins."

"By the gods! Then, why didn't you call for me the moment you heard her voice?"

"Well, the rules of the tournament say that we should not interfere in the affairs of the people of Varathia."

"Do you seriously think anyone is going to hold us accountable for saving one of the locals' lives? What's wrong with you, Barry? This isn't like you."

He rushes past me without another word, and heads towards the source of the sound. 

Kate, who was close enough to have heard our conversation, clears her throat and says:

"Do you seriously think anyone is going to hold us accountable for saving one of the locals' lives? What's wrong with you, Barry? I feel like I don't even know you anymore."

He rushes past me without another word, and heads towards the source of the sound. 

Kate, who was close enough to have heard our conversation, clears her throat and says:

"If it makes any difference, I think you made the right decision. There's no way of knowing for sure what will happen if we break the non interference rule."


[302]"Daren is the one you should thank, not us. He's the one that rushed to save you, despite the non interference rule of the mage tournament."

"I am well aware," the woman says, smiling politely. "That does not however deny the fact that the two of you eventually followed your friend here as well, in spite of that rule, and for that I thank you! My name is Rose. I'm pleased to meet you all!"

"If I may ask," Kate interrupts. "What were you doing all alone in the middle of the wilderness?"

"Well, miss, err..."

"Kate," says Kate, as she points toward herself. She then curtly points towards me and then Daren, giving Rose our names as well.

Rose smiles, and she continues.


[303]"We only did what anyone else would have done in our stead."

The woman smiles.

"Indeed. Most people would have done the same as you, and left me to die to not risk being banned from the tournament."

As the woman talks, I can feel my ears reddening. 

"But you eventually decided to follow your friend here in spite of the tournament's non interference rule, and for that I thank you! My name is Rose. I'm pleased to meet you all!"

"If I may ask," Kate interrupts. "What were you doing all alone in the middle of the wilderness?"

"Well, miss, err..."

"Kate," says Kate, as she points toward herself. She then curtly points towards me and then Daren, giving Rose our names as well.


[304]This isn't the time to worry about tournament regulations. That woman's life is in danger. We need to act now.

"Daren! Come quick!"

"What? What's wrong?"

"One of the locals is being attacked by a group of goblins nearby. If we hurry, we can make it in time to rescue her!"

Daren gets a serious look on his face and grabs his sword.

"Let's go," he says, and he follows me as I head in the direction of where I heard the scream.

As we get closer, the monsters' magical auras intensify. There's four of them, and they have the woman surrounded, but it doesn't seem like they've drawn blood yet.

When we finally get within visual range of the attackers, my suspicions get confirmed. They're goblins, alright. Vile and hideous creatures, not taller than four feet, with fangs instead of teeth, crooked noses, pointy ears and green skin. Despite their appearances, goblins are quite intelligent and are usually organized in clans with clearly defined hierarchies, unlike most other monster races. They're also smart enough to make and use tools, as well as weapons and armor. 


[305]

As soon as they see us, one of them yells something to his allies in a language I don't understand, and then they all quickly make themselves scarce. Visibly, they were not prepared for an actual fight.

After the goblins are gone, I turn around to make sure that the woman we just saved isn't hurt in any way. Now that I get a good look at her, I am briefly stunned by just how beautiful she is.  She has long auburn hair, a thin waist and a warm smile, while her facial features are soft and feminine, unlike those of Kate, and her light-brown eyes radiate kindness. She is wearing an auburn dress to match her hair, and she appears to be somewhere in her mid twenties. The woman is now bowing elegantly before us, as a gesture of gratitude.

"Thank you all so much for your help," she says. "I don't know what I would have done without you! My name is Rose. Pleased to meet you!"


[306]

As soon as they see us, one of them yells something to his allies. I suddenly realize he's speaking in one of the ancient languages that my stat device has taught me.

"Human warriors!" he says. "Forget the woman. Retreat!"

"Wait," I call out to him in their tongue.

"The human speaks our language?"

"Yes. Now tell me, why did you attack the woman?"

"Because we are starving, human. We weren't going to kill her. We just wanted to take the food she carries in her backpack."

"Why are you out here, robbing people? Shouldn't your clan be providing you with food and shelter?"


[307]I grab two copper pieces out of my right pocket and toss them over to the goblins. Their leader caught the two coins from the air, and is now looking at them as if he can't believe his eyes.

"What is the meaning of this?" he asks me.

"Two copper pieces. For your yearly tribute. Now you can go back to your clan and stop robbing people."

"No, I don't believe you! It's a trap! Don't listen to a word he says. It has to be a trap!"

"Um... Excuse me... mister goblin?"

I do not recognize the voice, so I turn around to see who just spoke. I realize it's the woman that we saved from the goblins. Now that I get a good look at her, I am briefly stunned by just how beautiful she is.  She has long auburn hair, a thin waist and a warm smile, while her facial features are soft and feminine, unlike those of Kate, and her light-brown eyes radiate kindness. She is wearing an auburn dress to match her hair, and she appears to be somewhere in her mid twenties. In her hand she is holding some blue berries that she is now showing to the goblins.


[308]"I think I got the main gist of the situation. Very well. Be on your way, then."

"We won't be bothering you any longer, human. We are not foolish enough to engage in an armed fight against trained human warriors."

As he turns to leave, we hear a woman's voice from behind us.

"Um... Excuse me... mister goblin?"

I do not recognize the voice, so I turn around to see who just spoke. I realize it's the woman that we saved from the goblins. Now that I get a good look at her, I am briefly stunned by just how beautiful she is.  She has long auburn hair, a thin waist and a warm smile, while her facial features are soft and feminine, unlike those of Kate, and her light-brown eyes radiate kindness. She is wearing an auburn dress to match her hair, and she appears to be somewhere in her mid twenties. In her hand she is holding some blue berries that she is now showing to the goblins.

"I overheard you talking about having trouble distinguishing between edible and poisonous berries, and I thought I might be able to help!"


[309]The goblin seems almost paralyzed. He hesitantly takes one of the berries and eats it. Once he sees for himself that it was not poisoned he starts to cry. As he sobs, one of his goblin friends comes to hug him, and they start crying together. 

So this is what it's like to be a goblin. I never knew. The woman with the auburn hair is looking at the goblins and smiling happily. It's incredible how happy she can be for some monsters that were about to rob her blind a few minutes ago.

Once he regains control of himself, the goblin leader turns back to us and says:

"Humans, I will never forget your kindness. I, Uluk Mihtun vow that I will repay this debt, to both of you. We will meet again. Until then..."

The goblin puts his left hand on his stomach, and his right hand on his chest. The rest of the goblins mimic his gestures, and they all say together:

"Tunak Madar!"

Tunak Madar... If I'm not mistaken, from what the stat device has taught me, I gather that this is one of the highest forms of respect and gratitude that exists in their language. It has no translation in any other languages that even comes close to its meaning.


[310]The goblin seems almost paralyzed. He hesitantly takes one of the berries and eats it. Once he sees for himself that it was not poisoned he starts to cry. As he sobs, one of his goblin friends comes to hug him, and they start crying together. 

So this is what it's like to be a goblin. I never knew. The woman with the auburn hair is looking at the goblins and smiling happily. It's incredible how happy she can be for some monsters that were about to rob her blind a few minutes ago.

Once he regains control of himself, the goblin leader throws himself to his knees, and thrusts his dagger into the ground. The rest of the goblins do the same as their leader, as he starts to speak.

"We are ashamed. You've shown us so much kindness, but we did not deserve any of it. All we can do is beg for your forgiveness."

The woman is looking embarrassed.

"Please," she says. "There's no need to apologize. You were only doing what you thought was best in order to survive and protect each other."

"We are not worthy of your words. I, Uluk Mihtun vow to you that I will repay this debt. We will meet again. Until then..."


[311]"All in the day's work!" I tell her.

"Oh?" she asks, smiling playfully. "I take it, then, that the reason you've joined this tournament is to help the people in need?"

"Well, I, uh..."

"Don't mind Barry," Daren says. "He just likes to boast in front of pretty ladies. As you may have guessed, we are just some participants in the mage tournament that happened to be close by and heard your scream. I'm sure anyone else in our position would have done the same."

"You are being too modest, mister swordsman. Many others would have likely hesitated to help me due to the tournament's rule of non interference, that is to say, if they'd have even been tempted to help me in the first place. I would have liked to repay you for your kindness, but I did not bring any money with me, since I was afraid I might run into robbers."

"If I may ask," Kate interrupts. "What were you doing all alone in the middle of the wilderness?"

"Well, miss, err..."


[312]"You were lucky that we managed to make it in time to rescue you. What were you thinking, coming out here all by yourself?"

"Barry, you're being too harsh," Daren tells me.

"No, he's right," Rose says. "Coming here alone was very reckless of me. It's just that... I was running out of time. And no one was willing to come with me to help. I had no choice..."

"If I may ask," Kate interrupts. "What were you doing all alone in the middle of the wilderness?"

"Well, miss, err..."

"Kate," says Kate, as she points toward herself. She then curtly points towards me and then Daren, giving Rose our names as well.

Rose smiles, and she continues.


[313]"No problem. We love helping people. But we also accept donations!"

"Damn it, Barry!" Daren says.

Rose giggles.

"It's alright, I took no offense at Barry's remark. I would have gladly rewarded you for rescuing me, but sadly, I did not bring any money with me, since I was afraid I might run into robbers."

"If I may ask," Kate interrupts. "What were you doing all alone in the middle of the wilderness?"

"Well, miss, err..."

"Kate," says Kate, as she points toward herself. She then curtly points towards me and then Daren, giving Rose our names as well.


[314]"Oh, no... My family is fine, thank the gods. I came here because all of the sick are too poor to afford the money to send anyone to collect herbs for them. And I did not have the money to hire bodyguards to come with me either. I am no doctor, but I volunteer to help tend to the sick as often as I can. With the death of our grand priest, the number of sick people increases every day. He was the last person in our town that knew how to create food using magic, and as much as he has tried, he did not succeed in teaching his craft to any of his disciples. Many people are starting to get poisoned because of eating the wrong berries from the forest, others are dying of starvation, and others have resorted to... to..."

She pauses for a bit to bring herself to say the words that were on her tongue.

"animal hunting," she finishes her phrase.

"Wait, so it's true that on your continent it is forbidden to hunt animals?" asks Daren, shocked.

"It... was. There was a time when each city in Varathia had at least ten people that knew how to create food out of nothing, by using magic. That skill was taught to them by the Creator, and they taught it to their disciples, as well as they could. But those that could pick up the skill were very rare and talented individuals. Since the very foundation of Varathia six hundred years ago, all of the cities relied heavily on the Creator to find these talented individuals, and teach them this craft. But then, the Creator simply disappeared about a hundred years ago, and the number of people that still knew the food making craft started to dwindle."


[315]"Why did the Creator disappear?"

"Nobody knows, for certain. There are many tales about what lead to his disappearance, but we have no way of knowing if any of them are true. Some of them say he went insane in the last few decades of his reign, and he simply left us without a word. Some of them say that he was disappointed with humankind, and decided to abandon us. Others say he simply got bored with us and went to create another civilization on a different continent. Most people, however, think he died, and that the kings of Varathia decided to hide this from the people in order to avoid creating panic. As long as the people still hold a hope that the Creator might return to save them all, there can still be some sense of order."

She pauses.

"But I must be boring you with these stories. I thank you all again from the bottom of my heart for rescuing me back there. I only wish there was something I could offer you in return."

Daren grins.

"Well, you'll have time to think about that on your way home, because we're coming with you."

"What?!" says Kate.


[316]"How did the Creator live so long? From what you're telling us, he must have lived at least a few hundred years?"

"Yes. That is one of the reasons why there are more and more people that don't even believe in his existence anymore. It's already been a long time since he disappeared, and he didn't really show himself to many people before, either. It was mostly only members of the royal families that got to see him. There are many that say that the Creator was simply an invention of the kings, and that they're using his disappearance as an excuse, in order to keep the power to create food for themselves. In some of the cities, these groups of people have started rebelling against their kingdoms, and are on the brink of civil wars." 

She pauses.

"But I must be boring you with these stories. I thank you all again from the bottom of my heart for rescuing me back there. I only wish there was something I could offer you in return."

Daren grins.

"Well, you'll have time to think about that on your way home, because we're coming with you."

"What?!" says Kate.


[317]"That sounds like a great idea."

"You too?" Kate asks me, disappointed.

"Well, it's not like we have anything to do until they give us our objectives," I tell her. "And we'll probably be safer in one of the cities than out here in the wild, where we keep getting attacked every few hours. Didn't you say yourself that you don't have any specific leads to the whereabouts of the friend you're looking for right now?"

"I... suppose, but--"

"Then it's settled!" says Daren enthusiastically. 

"No!" Kate says. "Nothing's settled! I never said I agree with this."

"Please, listen to me," Rose interrupts. "Daren, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but I do not want you to fight your friends over it. Trust me, I'll be fine. I know I may have seemed like I didn't know what I was doing back there, but in reality I've walked these roads by myself before. I've purposefully avoided all areas that are frequented by monsters or bandits, and have done plenty of research ahead of time. The only reason I ran into those goblins was because they were a rogue group, far away from any other goblin encampments. It won't happen again."

"Be quiet for a second," Kate says. "Do you hear that?"


[318]"Don't you think you should consult us before making such a decision?"

"Come on! What's gotten into you people? We'll be a lot safer inside a town than out here in the wilderness. Wouldn't it be better to wait somewhere safe until we get our objectives?"

"Finding a city is one thing, escorting a local to one is another. Rescuing her from goblins might not be interpreted as interfering with local affairs, but becoming her personal bodyguards threads dangerously close to 'outside interference' territory."

"We'll just say we needed a guide. Relax, we'll be fine."

"No, I agree with Barry," Kate says. "We shouldn't be wasting our time on escorting locals. The objectives could be announced any second."

"Please, listen to me," Rose interrupts. "Daren, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but I do not want you to fight your friends over it. Trust me, I'll be fine. I know I may have seemed like I didn't know what I was doing back there, but in reality I've walked these roads by myself before. I've purposefully avoided all areas that are frequented by monsters or bandits, and have done plenty of research ahead of time. The only reason I ran into those goblins was because they were a rogue group, far away from any other goblin encampments. It won't happen again."

"Be quiet for a second," Kate says. "Do you hear that?"


[319]"Stop!" she yells, and the mage named Clive stops in his tracks.

"Get out of my way, woman," he says. "Or I'll kill you along with that monstrosity you're so keen on defending."

"You can't hurt her. I won't let you. I owe her for saving my life. And you can't hurt me either. I am a citizen of Varathia!"

"Hah! You think their dumb rules can stop me? I've murdered people before. I'll teach you a little trick: as long as they don't catch you in the act, they have no real proof. What, you don't really believe in their fairy tales about their spell somehow teleporting me away before I kill you, do you? Anyone smarter than a rat would be able to tell that's just a bluff."

He's right. Even for magic, a spell like the one Varathia's claimed to have cast on us would go much beyond what we know is possible. To stop an attack before it even occurs, you would need something akin to... thought reading.

"Clive," one of the other men says. "Maybe you should let her be. We shouldn't be going around attacking locals on our second day."

"Don't worry, I won't be attacking her," Clive says with a wicked grin. "I'm just going to teach this little whore her place!"


[320]"Really? Because to me it just seemed reckless and stupid."

Kate, who is standing right beside me, smacks me in the back of my head.

"What the hell was that for?" I ask her.

"Do you have no tact whatsoever?"

"I have more than you. At least I don't smack people out of the blue for no good reason."

"Do you want another bump on your head to go with the one I just gave you?"

Rose lets out a giggle, which catches our attention.

"I'm sorry," she says, smiling. "It's just that you reminded me of my little brother and sister, who always have fights like this. You two seem really close."


[321]"Since when do you appreciate bravery and heroism?"

Kate, who is standing right beside me, punches me in my right shoulder. Her punch was strong enough to leave a decent bruise.

"Damn it, Kate. Have you ever heard of moderation?"

"Shut up! You asked for it. I was trying to be nice and you ruined the moment."

"Yeah, well, being nice doesn't suit you. Now, punching people, on the other hand..."

Rose lets out a giggle, which catches our attention.

"I'm sorry," she says, smiling. "It's just that you reminded me of my little brother and sister, who always have fights like this. You two seem really close."

Kate is blushing. This is the first time I've seen her blush since I've met her yesterday. It kind of suits her.
