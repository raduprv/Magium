[2]"This is where I wanted to bring you. Please, tell me what you can tell by studying the magic in this place..."

As I concentrate on the nature of the magic around me, I start sensing strong traces of elemental magic.

"It seems there's been at least one elementalist battling here," I tell her.

"Yes, but can you tell which element the caster was using?"

I try to focus even further. 

"It's uh... I'm not sure how to describe it. It doesn't seem to be any of the four traditional elements. If I were to put it into words, I'd say it would be... electric, in nature."

Kate's face slowly lights up when she hears my words. This is the first time I've seen her smile, even if only slightly, ever since we've first met.

"Thank you, stillw-- Barry... You've really been a great help!"

Her reaction took me by surprise.

"Wow. This is the first time I see this side of you. I didn't know you could actually be... nice."

"What's that supposed to mean?"


[3]I realize Daren must have also sensed the magic coming from the woman and concluded that she's been possessed by a banshee. Banshees are parasitic spirits that need to inhabit bodies in order to survive. They usually spend a few weeks inside a body in a dormant state before taking over. During this phase, the host may develop magical powers. Once a banshee is in full control of the body, they say she has awakened. The only way you can save the original host once she's been possessed by a banshee is to use white magic to purify her before the banshee has fully awakened, which basically means killing the banshee without harming the host.

However, the purification technique operates on the assumption that a woman cannot have magic powers of her own. They call it purification, but all the technique does in fact is to completely eradicate the aura that gives off the strong magical vibe, with the purpose of also eliminating the banshee along with it. On the other hand, if the aura does not in fact belong to a banshee, but to the woman herself, the purification would be nothing short of a death sentence. 

"No, wait. Listen to me!" I blurt out. "This woman isn't a banshee."

"So what, you're suggesting she's a mage, then? Barry, women can't be mages. There hasn't been a single recorded case of a woman mage in all of our world's history. Every time a woman's developed magical powers, it's been because of a banshee. Every single time."

"Don't you think I know that? But this one is different. If you try to purify her, you may well end up killing her!"


[4]"Very well," she says. "If that's the way it has to be, then I am forced to comply. But know that I'll be constantly watching my back. I am not as easily convinced as you, healer in armor."

"Great!" Daren says. "Now that we've got that settled, let's be off! Adventure awaits!"

"Wait," I call out. "You still didn't tell us your name."

The woman turns towards me and gives me a pondering look. After careful consideration, she decides to answer.

"It's Kate. My name is Kate."

With those last words, the three of us leave the clearing, and head into the forest, in the hopes of finding some place away from the ongoing battles that are being waged across the land. 


[5]The woman pauses to consider Daren's words.

"Very well," she says. "If that's the way it has to be, then I am forced to comply. But know that I'll be constantly watching my back. I am not as easily convinced as you, healer in armor."

"Great!" Daren says. "Now that we've got that settled, let's be off! Adventure awaits!"

[7]When the device harnesses enough energy, it announces me by beeping, and it then allows me to invest a limited number of points in my stats. At the moment, all of my stats are at zero, which means that the device's energy was completely depleted when I bought it. I guess I'll have to start leveling them from scratch.

Investing my points in stats is supposed to actually enhance my real attributes, as long as I keep the device close enough to me that it comes into contact with my magical aura. As I spend my time here, I'm expecting to hear these beeps more and more often. I'll have to think twice about the way I spend my points though, since I have no way of knowing when I'll get my next batch of points, and no way to change my mind after I've invested them. The maximum values that appear now for each stat are likely to increase as time passes.

This device is mostly used by fortune tellers because of its premonition stat. It provides them with some very vague glimpses into the future that they are then free to interpret to their own liking.  I wonder if the ancient languages stat actually means that I'll start being able to understand and speak ancient tongues. I heard there are many such writings on this continent. And I heard some people here don't speak the common tongue.


[8]"Hah! Stillwaters are legends and nothing more! I don't know what you were trying to achieve by joining this tournament, boy, but soon it won't matter anymore."

"Why?" Daren asks the bearded mage. "Why have you done this?"

He gestures towards the lifeless bodies lying all around us. 

"Nobody told us we should start killing each other!" Daren continues. "They told us there are no rules until they give us our first objectives. We don't even know if there was going to be combat involved! Why did you have to kill all of these people?"

"Because there are no rules," answers the mage with the battleaxe. "No rules means we can do whatever we want. And what we want is to eliminate as much of the competition as possible before the main event starts!"

He grins.

[10]"How long do you plan on defending this little whelp? You can't protect him and fight the both of us at the same time! Abandon the boy, and maybe you'll stand a chance!"

"Never!" Daren shouts as he slashes towards the bearded mage and his blade meets the battleaxe's steel yet again.

In the meantime, the mage fighting Kate has managed to surround her with floating swords, aimed at her from every direction. He sends them all at her simultaneously in an attempt to overwhelm her defenses. She quickly surrounds herself with a sphere of very thick ice, and all of the swords, once again stop into it. As she dismisses the sphere, all the hundreds of swords drop to the ground, with a deafening clang.

The mage with the dagger is very keen on landing a blow at me. Daren has managed to successfully block every one of his hits that were aimed at me, but he got himself hurt in the process more than once. Even with his full body armor equipped, I can tell he won't last much longer this way. Something needs to be done.


[11]As the two of them fight, I dash away towards the forest. As expected, the mage with the dagger is coming right after me.

"Barry, wait!" Daren shouts after me. 

He attempts to follow, but decides against it. He can't afford to avert his eyes from the bearded mage even for a second. He is too dangerous.

[12]"No!" shouts the older mage when he sees what happened to his eldest son. Taking his eyes off his opponent was a fatal mistake. Daren didn't waste his chance, and drove his blade right through the man's chest, his enchanted weapon cutting through the mage's heavy armor like a knife through butter. The bearded mage gave out one last gurgle, before he drowned in his own blood. 

Terrified, the young mage with the dagger tries to teleport into the forest to get away, but his spell's range appears to be limited, and it only transports him halfway there. He tries to make a run for it, but  Kate snipes him from a distance, with an ice cone through his head, which killed him instantly.

It was a gruesome show, but at this point, all I care about is that I somehow managed to make it out of that alive.

[14]Kate seems to have gone on the offensive. She is throwing ice cones towards the other young mage, and he is now forced to use his swords to cut them down, instead of attacking her. As he focuses more on defense, Kate's attacks become more and more relentless. It doesn't take her long until she starts sending hundreds of ice daggers towards her enemy. The mage doesn't seem to know how to use his technique to defend from such a large number of simultaneous attacks. It only takes a small miscalculation on his part to end the battle abruptly, as one of the ice daggers stabs him right through the heart, killing him on the spot.

"No!" shouts the older mage when he sees what happened to his eldest son. Taking his eyes off his opponent was a fatal mistake.

[18]I've searched very long for a way to get into Varathia, but the only way one can travel to their continent is by receiving a direct invitation. Very few of those are sent yearly, and the people being teleported there are being held under direct supervision for the duration of their stay, and return with no information regarding the coordinates of the place.

But when all hope seemed lost, the announcement came. A worldwide announcement by the kings of Varathia that they were organizing a tournament where every single mage in the world was invited. And the winner would be granted access to the Magium.   

I knew then that there would never be another chance like this. 

"Why did you join this tournament, Barry?" Daren asks me again.


[19]"If I might interrupt," Kate says. "I think we should get out of here as soon as possible, before anyone sees us standing amidst all of these dead bodies and figures we killed all of these people."

Daren glances back at her.

"I don't understand you, woman. With the way you were fighting back there, why would you ever ask for an escort?"

"Everyone has their weaknesses, healer... Judging by how much you've been struggling this fight, I would assume that ironically, you are weakest against other weapon enchanters such as yourself. But just because I handled these thugs with ease, it doesn't mean I won't have any problems against other foes. No one can survive this tournament alone."

"Yes... I suppose you're right."


[20]Daren and Kate are looking at me, dumbfounded. It occurs to me that the two of them probably didn't understand a word of what I've been saying. This must all sound like weird animal noises to them.

"Barry, what the hell?..." asks Daren.

"I'll explain later," I tell him. "They said they can lead us to their cave, in exchange for our protection. We're still looking for shelter, aren't we?"

"Well, I guess, but..."

"Then come on, she says it's this way," I say, as I follow the deer into the woods.

Daren is clearly very reluctant about all of this, but he follows me regardless. Kate looks more puzzled than skeptical, as she decides to follow me as well, into the depths of the forest and towards the mountains.
