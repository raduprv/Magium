[2]"This is where I wanted to bring you. Please, tell me what you can tell by studying the magic in this place..."

As I concentrate on the nature of the magic around me, I start sensing strong traces of elemental magic.

"It seems there's been at least one elementalist battling here," I tell her.

"Yes, but can you tell which element the caster was using?"

I try to focus even further. 

"It's uh... I'm not sure how to describe it. It doesn't seem to be any of the four traditional elements. If I were to put it into words, I'd say it would be... electric, in nature."

Kate's face slowly lights up when she hears my words. This is the first time I've seen her smile, even if only slightly, ever since we've first met.

"Thank you, stillw-- Barry... You've really been a great help!"

Her reaction took me by surprise.

"Wow. This is the first time I see this side of you. I didn't know you could actually be... nice."

"What's that supposed to mean?"


[3]"I just can't understand it," Daren tells me. "What are the organizers thinking? They're letting people without any trace of magic join this contest, and they don't even bother to enforce a rule that prohibits fighting before they announce the objectives. It's like they don't even care about all the lives that are at stake!"

"I don't think they do," I tell Daren. "Do you remember what they made us agree to before joining the tournament? Whoever wins this championship will be obligated to come to Varathia's aid in case of an outside invasion. People only agreed to it because there hasn't been an attempt at invading Varathia in thousands of years, but I don't think that's the point. They just want the most powerful mage in the world to serve as their own personal scarecrow. They probably only care about whoever's going to win."

"But even so, if their goal is to get their hands on a powerful mage, why have they still not announced the objectives? Wouldn't it be in their best interest to get this tournament finished as quickly as possible?"

[5]"Good morrow, lad!" Daren shouts after the boy. "Lovely day for a walk, isn't it? What business would you have with us? If you are lost, we'd be more than happy to give you directions!" 

With Daren, it's hard to tell when he's being sarcastic or sincere, since there are no hints in his look or his tone of voice, and as I've known him so far he'd be capable of either of those things in this situation. Our young visitor doesn't seem to have taken offense at Daren's remark, and smiles politely with his eyes still closed.

"There's no need," the boy answers. "I was looking for some old friends of mine when I sensed there was a fellow stillwater nearby, so I just had to stop by and say hello. There's so few of us nowadays, that it would be a shame to not at least greet each other in passing! My name is Eiden. Pleased to meet you!"

My whole body freezes for a second. An actual stillwater? Here? No... No. I should calm down. It's likely just some other guy who came up with the same idea as me. I refuse to fall for my own trick! 

Seeing that I don't say anything, Daren replies in my stead.

"Don't mind him! Barry's a little shy. I'm sure he's also pleased to make your acquaintance. My name's Daren."

"Oh? Then you must be the healer in armor I've been hearing so much about! And it seems that you also have a third member in your party. A survivor of the Beacon of Hope, no less. I did not know any of them were still alive."


[6]"Good morrow, lad!" Daren shouts after the boy. "Lovely day for a walk, isn't it? What business would you have with us? If you are lost, we'd be more than happy to give you directions!"

[8]Eiden smiles.

"You of all people should know better, healer in armor. Surely you must have seen all of the world's suffering and injustice throughout your travels. The anguish. The agony. You've seen them all, over and over. Tell me, healer. You've spent a lifetime trying to right the wrongs others have made. Do you feel like the world has become a better place because of it?"

"Just because there is a lot of evil left in the world doesn't mean there's no good worth fighting for. As long as I don't give up, I will find a way."

Eiden's smile widens, but his eyes remain closed.

"Oh? So you're an idealist, then. But tell me, hero, what happens when your pure ideals clash with the cold hard truth of reality?"

Suddenly, Daren falls flat on his chest, and I can tell he's being pressed against the ground by a very powerful force. 

"What happens when you meet a force so great that it simply squashes you against the ground, as if you were an insect?"

The force pushing Daren against the ground intensified so much that it made a large Daren shaped hole in the hard rock soil beneath him. He could no longer hold back the pain and started screaming in agony.


[9]"Aren't you a little young to be worrying about humanity's sins? Or is this some kind of phase you're going through in order to get your parents to notice you?"

Eiden smiles.

"You of all people should know better, healer in armor. Surely you must have seen all of the world's suffering and injustice throughout your travels. The anguish. The agony. You've seen them all, over and over. Tell me, healer. You've spent a lifetime trying to right the wrongs others have made. Do you feel like the world has become a better place because of it?"

"Just because there is a lot of evil left in the world doesn't mean there's no good worth fighting for. As long as I don't give up, I will find a way."

The force pushing Daren against the ground intensified so much that it made a large Daren shaped hole in the hard rock soil beneath him. He could no longer hold back the pain and started screaming in agony.


[10]Eiden smiles.

"Your life for Daren's."

I feel like my very soul is leaving my body. I am quickly losing control of all my muscles, and my body falls to the ground. Everything is getting colder, but I feel no pain. Only emptiness.

"It is done," the stillwater says, as he teleports out of our camp.

"Barry, no!" Daren screams from the top of his lungs, as he rushes towards me.

I did it. He's still alive. 

The last thing I see is Daren's desperate expression as he tries in vain to resuscitate me. 


[11]"Perfect."

Eiden releases Daren from his spell, and turns to leave. 

"I won't... let you leave this place," Daren says, as he slowly gets back up. 

"Surely, you must be kidding," Eiden tells him.

"If... I let you go now, you'll only hurt more innocent people. I'll stop you, no matter the cost."

"See, now that puts me in a difficult position, since I already made an even trade with Barry over there. I can't just kill you now, since it would violate the terms of our trade agreement."

"Silence!"

Daren rushes towards the stillwater and slashes fiercely towards his neck. Eiden dodges effortlessly, and Daren quickly goes for a second strike, this time meant to cut him in half. Eiden steps casually to the side, making it look like child's play. After a few more wasted strikes on Daren's part, just when it looked as though he might have caught the stillwater on the wrong foot, Eiden simply put his bare hand in front of his face, and stopped the full blow of the sword with only his index finger.

"No..." Daren says, as if he couldn't believe his eyes.


[12]"I've been looking for you, stillwater," Dave says. "I've been tracking your footsteps since yesterday. I told you we'd meet again. No one can run or hide from Cutthroat Dave."

"I'm afraid you are mistaken, my good man," says Eiden, smiling. "I am quite sure I've never seen you before in my life."

"Aye. I am sure of that too. You'd have needed to open your eyes in order to see me."

All of Cutthroat Dave's men suddenly burst into laughter at the same time. They're laughing loudly and vulgarly, probably in an attempt to intimidate their victim, just like a group of school bullies. Eiden's expression does not change, and he continues to smile pleasantly.

"Don't think you can fool me by changing your voice a little. I'm too smart for that. I'd recognize that arrogant tone of yours anywhere. Where's your healer friend? Did he leave you here to rot after you saved his skin?"

"Are you perhaps speaking of the healer in armor? If that's the case, then he's right there, past these trees."

"Hah! Nice try, stillwater. That intimidating trick of yours ain't gonna work on me twice in a row."

He turns towards his esteemed colleagues.


[13]"Sending your men to do your dirty work, Dave? I thought you were going to become a legend! Why are you hesitating?"

Dave pulls out a knife from his belt and slashes for Eiden's neck.

"Shut your smart-arse mouth and die, you little shi--"

Before the thug got to finish his sentence, Eiden put his palm on Dave's face, and made his head explode in a thousand pieces. Cutthroat Dave's life had ended just like that, without even having the time to realize he was dead. 

Blinded by rage, Dave's loyal followers rushed screaming towards Eiden, with their weapons at the ready. They didn't get too far, though. With a snap of his fingers, the stillwater made a huge pillar of fire appear in front of him, which incinerated all of the thugs to a point where not even their bones were left intact. The fire completely ignored all of the trees around it, and Eiden simply put it out with another snap of his fingers.

I expected this to be quick. But this outcome far exceeded my expectations. He can even cast fire magic. Just what in the hell are we supposed to do to fight this guy?

Eiden turns towards me. I suddenly remember that he relies primarily on his magical sense and not on his eyesight in order to assess his surroundings. He must have sensed my presence ever since before the beginning of the battle.


[14]"Now that I have your attention," the stillwater continues, "I want you to understand something. If you try something like that again, broken kneecaps are going to be the least of your worries. Are we clear?"

"Crystal."

Eiden's smile comes back to his face.

"That's what I like about you, Barry. Even in the face of utter annihilation, you manage to maintain your defiant, sarcastic tone. But you are neither strong nor brave. So what is it, then? What is the driving force that propels you forward?"

"Stupidity."

"Well said!" Eiden says, smiling. "I think your healer should have woken up from his slumber by now. Go ahead and call him. I'm sure he's fixed more than a few broken kneecaps in his lifetime. I'll be waiting for you to deliver my message. Do not fail me, Barry."

With these last words he turns his back to me, and heads deeper into the woods.


[15]"Boss, I think that's a banshee," one of Dave's henchmen tells him, visibly scared.

"Is she? I didn't know brothels hired banshees on this continent. Gotta get me one of those."

He grins maliciously and looks at Kate.

"Love, how much you chargin'? I bet I can make you enjoy yourself more than any of these two chumps. I'll make sure to give you lots of lovin'. Hehehe!"

Knowing Kate, my first thought was to look up. As I suspected, while Cutthroat Dave was talking, Kate was busy piling up floating ice swords in the sky. She sent them all flying at once. Five for each of them, just to make sure.

Dave's henchmen died on the spot, impaled by the many swords conjured by Kate. Their leader, however, managed to deflect four of the swords with his flying knives in the nick of time. The fifth sword went through his right leg.

"You cowards hired a whore for a bodyguard?!" Dave asks us, while struggling to mask the pain on his face. "How low can you get?"

"Looks like you're not all talk, cutthroat. But let's see you deflect the next ones."

"Wait, Kate," Daren says. "I think he's learned his lesson."

"You can't be serious! And what would you have us do? Send him off with a stern warning?"


[16]"He offered to deliver a message."

"A message?"

Kate looks at me before she continues.

"There's no way you'd have spared our lives for just one message. What are you really after?"

Eiden's smile widens again.

"Really, now. When's the last time you got an honest answer by asking a question like that?"

"Never. So I'll ask you this, instead. How do you know about the Beacon of Hope?"

"Is this really the question you should be asking? Shouldn't the question here be why your friends don't know anything about the Beacon of Hope?"

Kate looks at me again. I can see the hesitation in her eyes.

"It's complicated," she tells me, finally.

"Indeed, it is," Eiden says, and he turns to me. "Well, then. I'll be waiting for you to deliver my message. Do not fail me, Barry."

"Wait," Kate calls out to him, but Eiden pays her no heed and disappears into the darkness of the forest.


[17]"Thanks for letting me know where you were," says Daren. "I would've never found you if not for your constant yammering."

"You want me to mop the floor with you again, healer?! You think I can't fight you both?"

He attempts to send his flying knives into Daren, but because of the pain, he can't take full control of them and they drop to the ground before reaching him. Daren takes his sword out of the cutthroat and punches him in the stomach with brutal force. Dave falls on his rear, trying to gasp for air.

"You're not fighting anyone, Dave. You're finished. We're going to tie you to this tree, and let the gods decide your fate."


[18]Shortly after, Eiden emerges from the shadows, with his usual smile on his face. It doesn't take me long to realize who was behind the previous display of fireworks.

"See, Barry, this is how you deal with a vermin infestation. Tell me, what kind of a mailman dies before setting foot out of the post office? I have half a mind to file a complaint for your shoddy services."

"I'm... really sorry, I promise I'll do better next... time?"

"That's the spirit!"

"Barry!" I can hear Daren shout from outside the forest. 

A quick look outside shows me that all of Dave's henchmen have been dealt with, and Daren is now rushing towards my location.

As I turn back, I find to my surprise that Eiden is nowhere to be seen. He must have teleported away while I wasn't looking. 

"Deliver my message, Barry," I can hear Eiden's voice echo from the trees around me. "And do not fail me again."


[19]"Seriously, this is getting ridiculous," Eiden says.

"You know about stat boosters too?" I ask the stillwater.

"I do! And what I also know is why that stat booster works so well for you, specifically. Have you ever wondered why that is, Barry?"

He's right. The stat device has performed beyond all of my expectations since I got here. I didn't really give it much thought since I figured my calculations must have been wrong. But even with all of the energy it's accumulating, something is still clearly off.

"I have. But I don't suppose you're going to just give me the answer?"

"Of course not. Where would the fun in that be? But do not fret! As long as you remain on this continent, you will get your answers sooner or later."

He smiles.

"Well, then. I'll be waiting for you to deliver my message. Do not fail me, Barry."

With these last words he turns his back to me, and heads deeper into the woods.


[20]"Seriously, this is getting ridiculous," Eiden says.

He smiles.

"Well, then. I'll be waiting for you to deliver my message. Do not fail me, Barry."

With these last words he turns his back to me, and heads deeper into the woods.


[21]Once again, with one gesture of his hands, Eiden puts Daren to sleep in the middle of his sprint, which makes him fall on the ground and slide on his armor for a few feet before coming to a halt.

"Seriously, this is getting ridiculous," Eiden says.

"You know about stat boosters too?" I ask the stillwater.

"I do! And what I also know is why that stat booster works so well for you, specifically. Have you ever wondered why that is, Barry?"

He smiles.

"Well, then. I'll be waiting for you to deliver my message. Do not fail me, Barry."

With these last words he turns his back to me, and heads deeper into the woods.


[22]Three of his flying knives race towards me but I dodge them in the nick of time. We're battling in an open space and I already know how fast his daggers can go. I'm not going to let him surprise me.

I start running circles around the cutthroat in order to disorient him. He keeps sending his daggers at me, but they're not fast enough to catch me. He's trying to keep up with me, but I can see him slipping. I need to go faster. 

I keep running around him, dodging daggers left and right, looking for an opening. Every time he looks like he's lost sight of me, I jump in for him, but he manages to block my hits at the last moment. Faster. I need to go even faster.

I start to move more erratically, to confuse him even further. Cutthroat Dave keeps turning after me in order to not leave his back exposed, but he's starting to get dizzy. The look in his eyes is nowhere near as confident as it was when this fight began. His knives have yet to even touch me and I'm not feeling the least bit tired. 

There it is. The moment I've been waiting for. His eyes have lost their focus, and he's lost sight of me. I have him now. I take another lunge at him, this time with a lot more speed than before. He sees me and attempts to block my strike again, but he is too late. My knife went right through his chest, but I didn't hit any of his vital organs.

I only need one more hit to end this once and for all.


[23]I try to get close to him again, but his knives won't let me. This is getting me nowhere. I need to find a way to go on the offensive. 

"My daggers have a mind of their own, stillwater. You'll never escape from them no matter how hard you try."

That's it. His daggers have a mind of their own. He isn't controlling them all at the same time. I can use that to my advantage.

I take a good look to see where all his daggers are. I then make sure a few of them are following me and make a run for Cutthroat Dave. As before, a few of his daggers post themselves in front of me in order to defend their master. I wait until the final moment and slide underneath them, continuing my sprint towards the cutthroat. Dave readies two daggers he was holding in his hands, and prepares to block my strike. 

Instead of slashing at him, I feint an attack, and quickly side step to his right side. As I was hoping, he did not see the flying daggers that were following close behind me, and as a result, he did not get to stop them in time. Two of them went right through his stomach and another one through his left leg.

One more hit should finish this once and for all.


[24]"It's over, boy. It's too late to cry for mercy now. Don't think I'm going to give you an easy death. My knives like to play with their prey before they finish it. Say your prayers, you arrogant little git. Cutthroat Dave's going to enjoy AAAARRRGHHHHHH"

A pillar of fire appears in place of where Cutthroat Dave was originally standing, and his gloating gets replaced with desperate screams of agony. The fire completely ignores all of the vegetation around it, and when it dies out, I see that nothing remains of the cutthroat except for his ashes, that are now scattering in the wind.

Shortly after, Eiden emerges from the shadows, with his usual smile on his face. It doesn't take me long to realize who was behind the previous display of fireworks.

"See, Barry, this is how you deal with a vermin infestation."

"You!!!" Daren shouts, from the other end of the clearing. He seems to have finished dealing with Cutthroat Dave's henchmen and is now rushing towards the stillwater with his sword in hand.

Once again, with one gesture of his hands, Eiden puts Daren to sleep in the middle of his sprint, which makes him fall on the ground and slide on his armor for a few feet before coming to a halt.

"Seriously, this is getting ridiculous," Eiden says.

He turns his gaze back to me.

"Well, then. I'll be waiting for you to deliver my message. Do not fail me, Barry."

With these last words he turns his back to me, and he disappears into the darkness of the forest.


[26]The thugs make a run for the woods. I throw another rock in their general direction, but I don't bother chasing after them. Aiming my shots would be much more difficult in the forest, because of all the trees in my way. And besides, with the fear they had in their eyes, I doubt they'll be bothering us any longer.

There's a slow sound of clapping hands coming from the trees. Looking to see what's making the sound, I see Eiden, leaning against a pine tree with his usual smile on his face.

"Impressive, Barry," he says. "You don't often see stat boosters used so efficiently these days!"

You!!!" Daren shouts, and he rushes towards the stillwater.

Once again, with one gesture of his hands, Eiden puts Daren to sleep in the middle of his sprint, which makes him fall on the ground and slide on his armor for a few feet before coming to a halt.

He smiles.
