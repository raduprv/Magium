# Magium
This is the clickteam source code for the game Magium.

The author of the game Magium, Cristian Mihailescu, has sadly passed away on 6th of August 2024.
I am his brother, and with my mother's permission I am releasign the source code for Magium. Unfortunately the source code is non human readable, and it uses Clickteam Fusion. We hope that someone extracts all the text/conditions from the Clickteam project, and then sends them to me so that I can upload them here. Once they are in a more human readable format, more work can begin on porting the game to other languages, and hopefully finishing it too.
